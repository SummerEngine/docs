## How Do I Make Games with AI?

Summer Engine is an AI game engine. Describe what you want in natural language ("Add a player that can jump," "Create a main menu," "Import a 3D tree") and the AI modifies your scenes, writes code, and imports assets. No context switching. One environment.

<Card

>
  Build a complete game with full AI assistance, no coding required
</Card>

## How Do I Make Games with Cursor?

Use Cursor's AI to control Summer Engine. Add the MCP config, open your project, and ask Cursor to add nodes, set properties, import assets, or run the game. The AI has 23 tools: scene manipulation, debugging, project settings. All from your IDE.

<Card

>
  One-click install or manual config. 2 minutes to get started.
</Card>

## How Do I Make Games with Claude Code?

Claude Code can control Summer Engine via MCP. Add the config to `~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`, start the engine, and Claude can modify your game scenes, run the game, and debug, all from the same conversation.

  Add Summer Engine to Claude Code's MCP configuration
</Card>

## How Do I Make Games with Windsurf?

Windsurf's AI can use Summer Engine's MCP tools. Configure the MCP server, open your project in the engine, and build games from Windsurf: add nodes, import assets, run and debug.

<Card
  title="Windsurf Setup"
  icon="wind"
  href="/ai-tools/windsurf-setup"
>
  Configure Windsurf to use Summer Engine's MCP tools
</Card>

## How Do I Use the Summer Engine CLI?

The CLI (`summer` or `npx summer-engine`) installs the engine, creates projects, runs the engine, and starts the MCP server. No global install needed. Use `npx summer-engine install` and `npx summer-engine run`.

<Card

  All commands: install, login, run, create, list, mcp
</Card>

## How Do I Use the MCP API?

Summer Engine's MCP server exposes 23 tools over the Model Context Protocol. The same operations the built-in chat uses (AddNode, SetProp, SaveScene, ImportFromUrl) are available to any MCP-compatible AI tool. See the [API Reference](/api-reference/mcp) and [Tools Reference](/ai-tools/tools-reference).

## Full Engine, All Tools

Summer Engine gives you:

- **23 MCP tools**: Scene (AddNode, SetProp, SaveScene, etc.), Debug (Play, Stop, Snapshots), Project (settings, input, import)
- **Works with existing projects**: No conversion. Tutorials, plugins, and assets work as-is.
- **CLI + MCP + API**: Install via CLI, control via MCP, same local API under the hood
- **One workflow**: Whether you use the built-in chat, Cursor, Claude Code, or Windsurf, the operations are identical
