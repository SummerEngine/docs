Summer Engine is an AI game engine and coding agent, built to make it as fun to make games as it is to play them. Describe what you want to build or change in natural language and Summer Engine will write the code for you and help you create the first game assets for your game.
Instead of bouncing between ChatGPT, VS Code, and your game engine, you work in one unified environment where AI understands your entire game project and can modify scenes, code, and assets through natural language commands.

**What makes Summer Engine different:**
- **Works with existing projects**: Open your projects and keep working. Tutorials, libraries, and extensions work out of the box.
- **No lock-in**: Your projects stay yours. Open them in Summer Engine or your preferred editor anytime.
- **Project Intelligence**: AI understands your scenes, scripts, assets, and game logic
- **Safe Operations**: Changes go through safe APIs, so nothing breaks unexpectedly
- **Privacy-First**: Your code stays on your machine by default
