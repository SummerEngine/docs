Summer is a **native fork of Godot** with built-in AI capabilities. It's not just a plugin or overlayâ€”it's Godot itself, enhanced with AI superpowers.

Think of it as **Cursor for game development**. Instead of bouncing between ChatGPT, VS Code, and Godot, you work in one unified environment where AI understands your entire game project and can modify scenes, code, and assets through natural language commands.

**What makes Summer different:**
- **Built on Godot**: All Godot tutorials, libraries, and extensions work out of the box
- **Project Intelligence**: AI understands your scenes, scripts, assets, and game logic
- **Safe Operations**: Changes go through Godot's APIs, so nothing breaks unexpectedly
- **Privacy-First**: Your code stays on your machine by default

## Who is Summer For?

**Summer is designed for developers who want to build games faster**, not replace the development process. Think of it as a superpower for game developers who understand programming and design.

### Ideal For:
- **Indie developers** with 1-3 years experience
- **Small teams** wanting unified workflows
- **Experienced programmers** learning game development
- **Anyone frustrated** with tool-switching between editors, chatbots, and engines

### Not For:
- Complete beginners with zero programming experience
- Large AAA teams with established pipelines
- People wanting "make a game with one prompt" magic

**Honest expectation**: Summer can cut your development time by 50-80%, but you still need to understand game development fundamentals. It's a productivity boost, not a replacement for learning.
