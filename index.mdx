Summer Engine is an AI game engine and coding agent, built to make it as fun to make games as it is to play them. Describe what you want to build or change in natural language and Summer will write the code for you and help you create the first game assets for your game.
Instead of bouncing between ChatGPT, VS Code, and your game engine, you work in one unified environment where AI understands your entire game project and can modify scenes, code, and assets through natural language commands.

**What makes Summer different:**
- **Industry Standard Core**: Works with existing tutorials, libraries, and extensions out of the box
- **Project Intelligence**: AI understands your scenes, scripts, assets, and game logic
- **Safe Operations**: Changes go through safe APIs, so nothing breaks unexpectedly
- **Privacy-First**: Your code stays on your machine by default

## From Dreamer to Pro

Summer is designed for everyone who wants to make games. It combines the ease of "vibe coding" with the power of a professional game engine.

### For Creators & Vibe Coders
- **No code required**: Build complete games just by describing them in plain English
- **Instant Assets**: Generate 3D models, music, and sound effects on the fly
- **Learn as you go**: Watch how Summer builds things to learn game development naturally
- **Focus on fun**: Skip the boilerplate and get straight to the gameplay

### For Professional Developers
- **Ship commercial games**: We shipped *Don't Pray* on Steam in 2.5 months using Summer
- **Full Engine Access**: You have total control over every node and script
- **Code Quality**: AI writes clean, structured GDScript and C# that follows best practices
- **Accelerated Workflow**: Handle tedious tasks instantly so you can focus on architecture and polish

Summer removes boilerplate, accelerates iteration, and handles the hard parts, while giving you the option to dive as deep as you want. We integrate every new AI breakthrough (image, 3D, video models) within 24 hours of release.
