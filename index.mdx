Summer is a **native fork of Godot** with built-in AI capabilities. It's not just a plugin or overlay—it's Godot itself, enhanced with AI superpowers.

Think of it as **Cursor for game development**. Instead of bouncing between ChatGPT, VS Code, and Godot, you work in one unified environment where AI understands your entire game project and can modify scenes, code, and assets through natural language commands.

**What makes Summer different:**
- **Built on Godot**: All Godot tutorials, libraries, and extensions work out of the box
- **Project Intelligence**: AI understands your scenes, scripts, assets, and game logic
- **Safe Operations**: Changes go through Godot's APIs, so nothing breaks unexpectedly
- **Privacy-First**: Your code stays on your machine by default

## Built for Serious Developers

Summer is an AI‑native Godot fork for professional game developers who believe AI will revolutionize game development. This isn't a hobby engine—it's a production tool that accelerates serious development workflows and enables teams to build the bold, ambitious games of their dreams.

### Built for teams who
- **Ship commercial games** and need reliable, production-ready tooling
- **Value code quality** with proper architecture, testing, and maintainability
- **Work at scale** with large codebases, complex systems, and team collaboration
- **Demand control** over their development process, not magic black boxes
- **Believe in AI's potential** to unlock unprecedented creativity and productivity in game development

### Not for
- Hobby projects or "learn to code" tutorials
- One‑prompt "make my game" expectations
- Teams who don't understand or value proper software engineering

Summer removes boilerplate, accelerates iteration, and handles the tedious parts—while you maintain full control over architecture, code quality, and production decisions. We integrate every new AI breakthrough (image, 3D, video models) within 24 hours of release, keeping you at the forefront of what's possible.
