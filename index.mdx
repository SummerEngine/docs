Summer is an AI-powered game engine that understands your project and helps you build games faster through natural language. Just describe what you want to build or change and Summer will generate the code and make the editor changes for you.

Unlike using separate tools like ChatGPT in one tab, your code editor in another, and your game engine in a third, Summer centralizes everything into one unified experience with native AI integration.
