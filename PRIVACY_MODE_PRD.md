# Privacy Mode Implementation - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Privacy Mode is positioned as Summer's core differentiator and default operating mode. Based on the documentation created and Cursor's approach, this PRD outlines the technical requirements to deliver on our privacy promises to game developers.

**Key Promise**: "Your code is never used to train AI models. Period."

## Problem Statement

Game developers work on highly proprietary projects where code represents competitive advantage. Current AI coding tools often use developer code for training, creating concerns about:
- Intellectual property leakage to competitors
- Proprietary algorithms being learned by AI models
- Loss of competitive advantage through data sharing
- Compliance issues with NDAs and client contracts

## Solution Overview

Privacy Mode as the default operating mode for Summer, providing:
1. Zero data retention after request completion
2. Local-first processing where possible
3. Transparent data flow with immediate deletion
4. No training on user code, ever

## Core Requirements

### 1. Data Flow Architecture

**Current State Question**: How does our current data flow work?
- Where is code currently stored during processing?
- How long is it retained?
- Which services currently see user code?

**Required Architecture**:
```
User Code → Summer Client → Summer API → AI Provider → Response → User
                ↓
        Immediate deletion after response
        No persistent storage
        No training data extraction
```

**Implementation Questions**:
- Do we need to modify our current API architecture?
- How do we ensure immediate deletion across all services?
- What changes are needed to our current AI provider integrations?

### 2. Local-First Processing

**Requirement**: Project intelligence and analysis should happen locally when possible.

**Current State Questions**:
- What percentage of our current processing happens locally vs. cloud?
- Which features currently require cloud processing?
- What's the performance impact of moving more processing local?

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Local AST parsing and code analysis
- Local project indexing and search
- Local pattern recognition for coding style
- Only send code to cloud for AI generation/modification requests

**Technical Questions**:
- What libraries/tools do we need for local processing?
- How do we handle different programming languages locally?
- What's the memory/CPU impact on user machines?
- How do we sync local analysis with cloud AI context?

### 3. Zero Data Retention

**Requirement**: Code is deleted immediately after processing, with no exceptions.

**Implementation Details**:
- No database storage of user code
- No log files containing code snippets
- No caching of code for performance
- No "anonymized" data extraction
- Conversation context cleared on session end

**Technical Questions**:
- How do we modify our current logging to exclude code?
- What changes needed to error reporting (Sentry, etc.)?
- How do we handle conversation context without persistent storage?
- What's the performance impact of no caching?

**Database/Storage Requirements**:
- Audit all current data storage points
- Implement automatic data purging
- Add deletion confirmations/logging
- Ensure no code in backup systems

### 4. AI Provider Integration

**Current Providers** (based on documentation):
- Anthropic (Claude)
- OpenAI (GPT)
- Google (Gemini)

**Requirements**:
- Zero data retention agreements with all providers
- Code sent only during active user requests
- No training on user data
- Immediate deletion after response

**Implementation Questions**:
- Do we have zero retention agreements in place?
- How do we verify providers are deleting data?
- What API flags/parameters ensure no training?
- How do we audit provider compliance?

**Technical Implementation**:
- Add privacy headers to all AI API requests
- Implement request/response logging (without code content)
- Add provider-specific privacy controls
- Monitor for any training opt-out violations

### 5. Transparency and Verification

**Requirements**:
- Users can see what data we have about them
- Processing logs (without revealing code content)
- Deletion confirmations
- Third-party access logs

**Implementation Questions**:
- How do we log processing without storing code?
- What user-facing tools do we need for transparency?
- How do we provide deletion confirmations?
- What audit trails are needed for compliance?

## Technical Architecture Changes

### Client-Side Changes

**Local Processing Engine**:
- Implement local code analysis (AST parsing, dependency mapping)
- Local project intelligence and indexing
- Local conversation context management
- Encrypted communication with servers

**Questions**:
- What's the size impact on the client application?
- How do we handle updates to local processing models?
- What platforms need different implementations?
- How do we handle offline functionality?

### Server-Side Changes

**Stateless Processing**:
- Remove all persistent code storage
- Implement immediate data purging
- Stateless conversation handling
- Enhanced encryption for data in transit

**API Modifications**:

- Add automatic cleanup on request completion
- Enhanced logging (without code content)

**Questions**:
- How do we handle conversation context without storage?
- What's the performance impact of stateless processing?
- How do we scale without caching user data?
- What monitoring do we need for privacy compliance?

### Infrastructure Changes

## Conclusion

Privacy Mode represents both our core value proposition and a significant technical undertaking. The implementation requires changes across our entire stack, from client-side processing to server architecture to AI provider integration.

The key to success is maintaining our privacy promises while delivering the AI assistance that makes Summer valuable. This means thoughtful trade-offs, excellent local processing, and absolute transparency about our data handling.

**Recommendation**: Start with Phase 1 (Foundation) immediately to establish the basic privacy infrastructure, then iterate quickly through the remaining phases. Privacy should be the foundation everything else builds on, not an afterthought.
