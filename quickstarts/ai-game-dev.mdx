## Make a Game with Summer Agent

Summer Engine lets you build complete games by describing what you want. Use **Summer Agent**—the built-in AI assistant in Summer Engine—to write code, create assets, and set up your game. No coding experience required.

## What is Summer Agent?

**Summer Agent** is Summer Engine's native AI assistant (like Cursor Agent in Cursor). You describe your game in plain English and Summer Agent does the technical work. You focus on the creative vision; Summer Agent handles the implementation.

## Step 1: Get Summer Engine

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Summer Engine">
    Visit [summerengine.com](https://summerengine.com) and download for Mac or Windows
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign in with Google, GitHub, or email. No credit card required
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Describe Your Game

Create a new project, then tell Summer Agent what you want. Examples:

- **"Create a 2D platformer with a character that can jump and double-jump"**
- **"Make a top-down shooter with enemies that chase the player"**
- **"Build a puzzle game where you match colored blocks"**
- **"Add a main menu with Start and Quit buttons"**
- **"Generate a low-poly tree for my forest scene"**

Summer Agent understands natural language. You don't need to be precise. Just describe what you want.

## Step 3: Review and Iterate

- **Review changes**: Summer Agent shows you what it will change before applying
- **Undo anytime**: All Summer Agent changes use the standard undo system
- **Refine with follow-ups**: "Make the jump higher" or "Add more platforms"

## What You Can Build with Summer Agent

- **Game logic**: Movement, combat, scoring, menus
- **2D and 3D assets**: Characters, environments, props (Summer Agent–generated)
- **Audio**: Music and sound effects (Summer Agent–generated)
- **UI**: Menus, HUDs, buttons
- **Physics**: Collision, gravity, interactions
