## Make a Game with Full AI Assistance

Summer Engine lets you build complete games by describing what you want. No coding experience required. This is AI game development. Describe your vision, and Summer Engine writes the code, creates assets, and sets up your game.

## What is AI Game Dev?

**AI game dev** (sometimes called "vibe coding" for games) means you describe your game in plain English and the AI does the technical work. You focus on the creative vision; Summer Engine handles the implementation.

## Step 1: Get Summer Engine

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Summer Engine">
    Visit [summerengine.com](https://summerengine.com) and download for Mac or Windows
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign in with Google, GitHub, or email. No credit card required
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Describe Your Game

Create a new project, then tell Summer Engine what you want. Examples:

- **"Create a 2D platformer with a character that can jump and double-jump"**
- **"Make a top-down shooter with enemies that chase the player"**
- **"Build a puzzle game where you match colored blocks"**
- **"Add a main menu with Start and Quit buttons"**
- **"Generate a low-poly tree for my forest scene"**

Summer Engine understands natural language. You don't need to be precise. Just describe what you want.

## Step 3: Review and Iterate

- **Review changes**: Summer Engine shows you what it will change before applying
- **Undo anytime**: All AI changes use the standard undo system
- **Refine with follow-ups**: "Make the jump higher" or "Add more platforms"

## What You Can Build with AI Alone

- **Game logic**: Movement, combat, scoring, menus
- **2D and 3D assets**: Characters, environments, props (AI-generated)
- **Audio**: Music and sound effects (AI-generated)
- **UI**: Menus, HUDs, buttons
- **Physics**: Collision, gravity, interactions
