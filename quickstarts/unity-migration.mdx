## Migrate from Unity to Summer Engine

You can migrate your Unity project to Summer Engine. The workflow: have the AI use shell and tools to research your existing project, create a migration plan, then rebuild in Summer Engine. Relatively fresh projects can often be done in one pass; larger projects need more planning.

## Step 1: Prepare Your Unity Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Document your project">
    Have a clear picture of your scenes, scripts, and assets. The AI will need to understand your structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="Download Summer Engine">
    Visit [summerengine.com](https://summerengine.com) and download
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a new Summer Engine project">
    Start fresh in Summer Engine. You'll rebuild, not import
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Use AI to Research and Plan

In Summer Engine's chat, ask the AI to:

- **"Use shell and tools to research my Unity project at [path]. Analyze the structure, scenes, and scripts. Create a migration plan."**
- **"Based on my Unity project structure, what's the best order to rebuild the core systems?"**
- **"List the main scenes and prefabs I need to recreate"**

The AI can read your Unity project files (C# scripts, scene structure, asset references) and create a step-by-step plan.

## Step 3: Rebuild with AI Assistance

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with core systems">
    Rebuild your player, camera, and core mechanics first. Describe what you had: "Create a 3D character controller like my Unity Rigidbody setup"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Recreate scenes">
    Describe each scene: "Build a level with a ground plane, obstacles, and spawn points"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import or regenerate assets">
    Use Summer Engine's AI asset generation for placeholders, or import your existing art and audio
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Project Size Matters

| Project Size | Difficulty | Approach |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| **Fresh / small** | Easy | Often one-shot. Describe the game, AI rebuilds it |
| **Medium** | Moderate | Break into systems. Migrate scene by scene |
| **Large** | Planning required | AI researches first, creates detailed plan. Migrate in phases |
