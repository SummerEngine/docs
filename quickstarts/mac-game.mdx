## Make a Mac Game with Summer

Build your game with AI assistance, then export for macOS. Summer supports both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

## Step 1: Build Your Game

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download Summer">
    Visit [summerengine.com](https://summerengine.com) and download for Mac
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a project">
    New Project → Create your game with AI. Describe what you want in natural language
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate with AI">
    Refine through conversation. "Add a settings menu", "Optimize for Retina displays"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Enable Texture Compression

Before exporting, enable ETC2/ASTC (required for Apple Silicon):

1. **Project → Project Settings**
2. **Rendering → Textures → VRAM Compression**
3. **Enable "Import ETC2 ASTC"**
4. Wait for reimport (1-5 minutes)

## Step 3: Export for macOS

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create export preset">
    Project → Export → Add → macOS (Runnable)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set bundle identifier">
    Replace `com.example.game` with your unique ID (e.g. `com.yourstudio.yourgame`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export">
    Click Export. You get a .app bundle ready for distribution
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>Releasing on both Mac and Windows? Enable both ETC2 ASTC and S3TC BPTC texture formats at once to avoid reimporting twice.</Tip>
