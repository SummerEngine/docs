## Make a PlayStation Game with Summer

Summer has full PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 export support. Build your game with AI on PC first, then port to PlayStation once you have PlayStation Partners approval.

## Step 1: Build Your Game on PC

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your game in Summer">
    Build with AI assistance. Target Windows or Mac first

    PlayStation Partners wants to see professional-quality gameplay, visuals, and a clear market potential

  <Step title="Apply to PlayStation Partners">
    Apply at [partners.playstation.net](https://partners.playstation.net). You need a registered company, game pitch, and business plan. Approval typically takes 4-8 weeks
  </Step>

## PlayStation Requirements

- **PlayStation Partners approval** — Required before SDK access
- **Dev kit** — PS4 (~$2,500), PS5 (~$2,500)
