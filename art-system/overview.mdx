## What is the Summer Asset Store?

The Summer Asset Store is a comprehensive platform for creating, sharing, and discovering game assets - both AI-generated and human-crafted. We believe the future of game development includes both human creativity and AI assistance working together, not replacing each other.

**Our Philosophy**: AI art is a tool, like Photoshop or Blender. It can help developers prototype faster and create placeholder assets, but it will never replace the unique vision, style, and intentionality that human artists bring to games. We're transparent about what's AI-generated and what's human-made, because both have their place in game development.

Whether you need sprites, textures, UI elements, or concept art, you can generate them using AI for rapid prototyping or browse community-created assets made by talented human artists.
