## AI Assets for Game Development

Summer's **Studio** lets you create assets, upload and organize your own existing ones, and have Summer import any asset directly into your games on command. AI asset generation is designed for **game development**: getting your game playable and testable quickly.

**Realistic Expectations:**
- AI assets work best for simple, clear concepts
- Complex or stylized assets may need refinement
- Perfect for placeholders and iteration
- Not suitable for polished, commercial releases

**What AI Assets Do Well:**
- Basic character sprites and animations
- Simple environment backgrounds
- UI elements and buttons
- Concept exploration and mood boards

**What Needs Human Artists:**
- Complex character designs with personality
- Detailed environment art
- Brand-consistent visual style
- High-quality promotional materials

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Studio">
    In Summer, go to Studio and use the Create tabs: 2D, 3D, Audio, or Video
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Style">
    Select from preset styles like Realistic, Cartoon, Anime, Pixel Art, Low-Poly, or Fantasy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Your Prompt">

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Writing Effective Prompts

### Basic Structure
Start with the main subject, then add details about style, mood, and composition:

```
[Subject] + [Style] + [Mood/Lighting] + [Composition]
```

### Examples

**Character Sprites**
```
A brave knight in silver armor, cartoon style, bright cheerful lighting, facing forward for game sprite
```

**Environment Textures**
```
Seamless stone brick texture, medieval fantasy style, weathered and moss-covered, tileable pattern
```

**UI Elements**
```
Wooden game button with gold trim, fantasy RPG style, glowing hover effect, ornate carved details
```

**Concept Art**
```
Mystical forest clearing, anime style, soft magical lighting, ancient ruins in background
```

## Style Presets

Each style is optimized for different game genres and aesthetics:

### Realistic
- **Best for**: Modern games, simulators, realistic environments
- **Characteristics**: Photorealistic rendering, detailed textures, natural lighting
- **Example**: "Realistic brick wall texture with subtle wear and weathering"

### Cartoon
- **Best for**: Family games, mobile games, casual titles
- **Characteristics**: Bright colors, simplified shapes, friendly appearance
- **Example**: "Cartoon treasure chest with golden coins spilling out"

### Anime
- **Best for**: JRPGs, visual novels, character-focused games
- **Characteristics**: Stylized proportions, vibrant colors, expressive features
- **Example**: "Anime-style magical girl character with flowing blue hair"

### Pixel Art
- **Best for**: Retro games, indie titles, 2D platformers
- **Characteristics**: Sharp pixels, limited color palettes, nostalgic feel
- **Example**: "16-bit pixel art sword with glowing enchantment effect"

### Low-Poly
- **Best for**: Mobile games, minimalist aesthetics, performance-focused titles
- **Characteristics**: Flat colors, geometric shapes, clean edges
- **Example**: "Low-poly mountain landscape with simple geometric trees"

### Fantasy
- **Best for**: RPGs, adventure games, medieval settings
- **Characteristics**: Magical elements, medieval themes, rich details
- **Example**: "Fantasy spell book with glowing runes and leather binding"

## Advanced Features

### Prompt Enhancement
Summer can automatically improve your prompts using AI:

<Tip>
**Original**: "A sword"  
**Enhanced**: "A gleaming medieval longsword with ornate crossguard, leather-wrapped grip, and polished steel blade reflecting light, fantasy RPG style"
</Tip>

### Reference Images
Upload reference images to guide the style and composition:
- **Style Reference**: Match the artistic style of an existing image
- **Composition Reference**: Use the layout and structure as a guide
- **Color Reference**: Extract color palettes from reference images

### Regeneration Options
- **Regenerate**: Create a completely new version with the same prompt
- **Refine**: Make subtle adjustments to the current result
- **Variations**: Generate multiple versions to choose from

## Asset Metadata

When creating assets, provide detailed information for better discoverability:

### Required Information
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive name for your asset
- **Asset Type**: 2D Image, Texture, Sprite, UI Element, etc.
- **Tags**: Keywords that help others find your asset

### Optional Details
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the asset and its intended use
- **License**: How others can use your asset (Free, Commercial, Attribution, Contact)
- **Visibility**: Public (visible to all) or Private (only visible to you)

## Best Practices

### For Game Sprites
- Specify the intended use: "for 2D platformer game"
- Include pose/direction: "facing right, idle pose"
- Mention transparency needs: "on transparent background"

### For Textures
- Always specify "seamless" or "tileable" for repeating textures
- Include resolution hints: "high resolution", "detailed"
- Mention intended surface: "for stone walls", "metal armor texture"

### For UI Elements
- Specify the UI context: "game menu button", "health bar design"
- Include state variations: "normal, hover, and pressed states"
- Mention size considerations: "scalable vector style"

### For Concept Art
- Set the scene: "wide landscape shot", "character portrait"
- Include mood descriptors: "mysterious", "heroic", "peaceful"
- Specify viewing angle: "from below", "bird's eye view"

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Blurry or Low-Quality Results
- Add "high quality", "detailed", or "sharp" to your prompt
- Try regenerating with a more specific style preset
- Use reference images for better guidance

### Wrong Style or Aesthetic
- Be more specific about the art style you want
- Try different style presets
- Include negative prompts: "not cartoon style" or "avoid realistic rendering"

### Unwanted Elements
- Be specific about what you don't want: "no text", "no people", "clean background"
- Use composition terms: "centered", "isolated object", "simple background"

### Inconsistent Results
- Save successful prompts for reuse
- Use reference images for consistency
- Create variations of working prompts rather than starting over

## Integration with Projects

Assets (whether AI-generated, uploaded, or from the Store) flow directly into your games:

1. **Direct Import**: Ask Summer to add any asset to your game; it places it in the right folder and wires it up
2. **My Assets Library**: Create, upload, and organize your assets in Studio; Summer can import any of them on command
3. **Prototype Workflow**: Perfect for rapid prototyping and testing gameplay mechanics
4. **Transition Planning**: Summer can help you identify which AI assets to replace with human-created assets later

<Info>
**Pro Tip**: Use AI assets to get your game playable quickly, then gradually replace key assets with human-created work as you approach release. This hybrid approach lets you validate your game concept without upfront art costs.
