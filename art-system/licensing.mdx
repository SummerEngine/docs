## Using Licensed Assets

### Attribution Requirements

When using Attribution Licensed assets, include credits in:

- "Fantasy Sword Sprite" by ArtistName (Summer Studio)
- "Stone Texture Pack" by CreatorName (Summer Studio)
```

**Documentation**
```

```

```markdown
## Assets

```

### Best Practices for Attribution

**Be Specific**
- Include the exact asset name
- Mention the creator's Summer username
- Note that it came from Summer Studio

**Be Visible**
- Place attributions where players can easily find them
- Include in main game credits, not just documentation
- Consider in-game attribution for heavily featured assets

**Keep Records**
- Save license information when downloading
- Track which assets require attribution
- Update credits if you modify or remove assets

## License Compliance

### Before Using an Asset

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the License">
    Carefully review the license terms on the asset page
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Compatibility">
    Ensure the license works with your project type (personal/commercial)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan Attribution">
    If attribution is required, plan how you'll credit the creator
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Documentation">
    Keep records of what you've downloaded and under what license
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Compliance Mistakes

❌ **Using Commercial-Only assets in personal projects**
- Always check if commercial licenses allow personal use

❌ **Forgetting attribution requirements**
- Set up your credits system early in development

❌ **Assuming "Free" means "No restrictions"**
- Even free licenses have terms about ownership and redistribution

❌ **Not keeping license records**
- Track what you've used to ensure compliance at release

## Licensing for Teams

### Team Projects
When working in teams, ensure:
- All team members understand licensing requirements
- Someone is responsible for tracking asset licenses
- Credits and attribution are consistently managed
- License compliance is checked before release

### Client Work
For client projects:
- Verify that licenses allow commercial use by third parties
- Transfer appropriate usage rights to clients
- Document all asset licenses in project handover
- Consider client's ongoing licensing obligations

## Dispute Resolution

### If You Think Your Rights Were Violated
1. **Contact the User**: Try direct communication first
2. **Document the Violation**: Screenshots, links, evidence
3. **Report to Summer**: Use the report system on the platform
4. **Legal Action**: For serious cases, consult legal counsel

### If Someone Claims You Violated Their Rights
1. **Review Your Usage**: Check the license terms you agreed to
2. **Communicate Openly**: Respond to concerns promptly

4. **Seek Mediation**: Use Summer Engine's dispute resolution if available
