- Include in main game credits, not just documentation
- Consider in-game attribution for heavily featured assets

**Keep Records**

- Track which assets require attribution
- Update credits if you modify or remove assets

## License Compliance

### Before Using an Asset

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read the License">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Check Compatibility">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Documentation">
    Keep records of what you've downloaded and under what license

### Common Compliance Mistakes

‚ùå **Using Commercial-Only assets in personal projects**

## Licensing for Teams

### Client Work
For client projects:

- Document all asset licenses in project handover
- Consider client's ongoing licensing obligations

## Dispute Resolution

### If You Think Your Rights Were Violated
1. **Contact the User**: Try direct communication first
