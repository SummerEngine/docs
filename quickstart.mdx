    3. **Click "Create & Open"** → Summer opens with a chat window on the right
    4. **Watch Summer think** → It's learning about your new project (takes a few seconds)

    <Tip>The chat window is where you'll talk to Summer. Think of it as your creative partner!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="message-square" title="Have your first conversation">
    Ready to see Summer in action? Try typing these:

    **"Create a player character that I can move around"**
    - Summer creates a character for you
    - Adds movement controls (arrow keys or WASD)
    - You can immediately test it by pressing the play button!

    - Sets up physics so your character can land on them

    **"Make the camera follow my player"**
