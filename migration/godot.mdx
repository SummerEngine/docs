## Coming from Godot?

If you're familiar with Godot, you'll feel right at home in Summer. The interface, node system, and scripting work exactly the same way you're used to.

<Note>
Quick migrations will soon be available. As Summer is based on the Godot codebase, it allows us to focus on making the best AI-powered game development experience while maintaining a familiar editing environment. This makes it easy to migrate your existing Godot settings to Summer.
</Note>

## What's the Same

Everything you know about Godot still applies in Summer:

- **Node system** - All the same nodes, properties, and relationships
- **GDScript** - Your existing scripts work without changes  
- **Scene structure** - `.tscn` files are identical
- **Project settings** - Same export options and configurations
- **Asset pipeline** - Import settings and resource formats unchanged

## What's Different

Summer adds AI capabilities on top of the familiar Godot experience:

### AI Chat Panel

- **Location**: Docked on the right side of the editor
- **Purpose**: Natural language interface to modify your project
- **Integration**: Directly connected to the editor's APIs

### Enhanced Workflow

Instead of manually clicking through menus:

1. **Describe what you want** - "Add a player character with movement"
2. **Review the plan** - Summer shows you what it will change
3. **Apply or modify** - Accept changes or ask for adjustments
4. **Undo if needed** - All AI changes use the standard undo system

## Project Compatibility

Your existing Godot projects work in Summer:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="folder-open" title="Opening Godot projects">
    1. **File → Open Project** (or use Project Manager)
    2. **Browse to your Godot project folder**
    3. **Select project.godot file**
    4. **Click "Open"**
    
    Summer will automatically index your project files for AI understanding.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="sync" title="Project indexing">
    When you first open a project, Summer:
    - Scans all scripts, scenes, and assets
    - Builds an understanding of your project structure  
    - Enables AI to provide contextual help
    - Takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on project size
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="question" title="Will my Godot plugins work?">
    Most Godot plugins work in Summer without changes. However, plugins that modify the editor interface may need updates for AI integration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="question" title="Can I go back to Godot?">
    Yes! Summer projects are standard Godot projects. You can open them in regular Godot anytime.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="question" title="What about version compatibility?">
    Summer is based on Godot 4.x. Projects from Godot 3.x will need the standard Godot 3→4 migration process.
