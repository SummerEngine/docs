## Godot Migration

Summer Engine is based upon the Godot codebase, allowing us to focus on making the best AI-powered game development experience while maintaining a familiar editing environment. This makes it easy to migrate your existing Godot settings to Summer Engine.

## Profile Migration

Quick migrations will soon be available. If you're familiar with Godot, you'll feel right at home in Summer Engine. The interface, node system, and scripting work exactly the same way you're used to.

## What's the Same

Everything you know about Godot still applies in Summer Engine:

- **Node system** - All the same nodes, properties, and relationships
- **GDScript & C#** - Your existing scripts work without changes  
- **Scene structure** - `.tscn` files are byte-for-byte identical
- **Project settings** - Same export options and configurations
- **Asset pipeline** - Import settings and resource formats unchanged

## Zero Lock-in

Summer Engine projects ARE Godot projects. Identical file formats:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `.gd` | GDScript source (text) |
| `.tscn` / `.scn` | Scene files |
| `.tres` / `.res` | Resource files |
| `project.godot` | Project configuration |

**No proprietary formats. No metadata injection.** A `git diff` between a Summer Engine-edited file and a Godot-edited file shows only your changes.

### Team Workflows

Team members can use Summer Engine and vanilla Godot interchangeably:
- Artist opens project in Godot, edits scenes
- Programmer opens same project in Summer Engine, uses AI assistance  
- Both commit to the same repo
- No merge conflicts from tooling differences

### Worst Case

Summer Engine disappears tomorrow? Your project opens in Godot 4 without modification. You lose AI assistance. Your game, code, and assets are unaffected.

## What's Different

Summer Engine adds AI capabilities on top of the familiar Godot experience:

### AI Chat Panel

- **Location**: Docked on the right side of the editor
- **Purpose**: Natural language interface to modify your project
- **Integration**: Directly connected to the editor's APIs

### Enhanced Workflow

Instead of manually clicking through menus:

1. **Describe what you want** - "Add a player character with movement"
2. **Review the plan** - Summer Engine shows you what it will change
3. **Apply or modify** - Accept changes or ask for adjustments
4. **Undo if needed** - All AI changes use the standard undo system

## Project Compatibility

Your existing Godot projects work in Summer Engine:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="folder-open" title="Opening Godot projects">
    1. **File → Open Project** (or use Project Manager)
    2. **Browse to your Godot project folder**
    3. **Select project.godot file**
    4. **Click "Open"**
    
    Summer Engine will automatically index your project files for AI understanding.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="sync" title="Project indexing">
    When you first open a project, Summer Engine:
    - Scans all scripts, scenes, and assets
    - Builds an understanding of your project structure  
    - Enables AI to provide contextual help
    - Takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on project size
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="question" title="Will my Godot plugins work?">
    Most Godot plugins work in Summer Engine without changes. However, plugins that modify the editor interface may need updates for AI integration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="question" title="Can I go back to Godot?">
    Yes! Summer Engine projects are standard Godot projects. You can open them in regular Godot anytime.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="question" title="What about version compatibility?">
    Summer Engine supports Godot 4.x project formats. Projects from Godot 3.x will need the standard Godot 3→4 migration process.
