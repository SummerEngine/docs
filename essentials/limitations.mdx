## What Summer Does Today

Summer is built for production game development. Here's what works well and what we're improving.

<Note>
We ship updates frequently based on developer feedback. Your input shapes the roadmap.
</Note>

## Project Intelligence

### Project Indexing

Each project has its own isolated search index. When you open a project, Summer indexes your scripts, scenes, and assets to enable AI-powered search and understanding.

### File Discovery

**What works**: Finds all scripts, scenes, and assets in your project

**Limitation**: Re-indexes daily, not on every file save

**Impact**: Very new files might not appear in search immediately

**Workaround**: Ask the AI to "explore the project structure" to find recent files

## Authentication & Desktop Integration

### Authentication Flow

**What works**: One-time login, persistent across app restarts

**Limitation**: Login happens in embedded browser (some OAuth providers may block)

**Workaround**: Use email/password if OAuth fails

### File Operations

**What works**: Add nodes, set properties, connect signals, read any file

**Limitation**: Large file operations (>10MB) may be slow

**Impact**: AI will ask for confirmation before large operations

## AI Chat Features

### Tool Calls

**What works**: Editor operations, file reading, project exploration, grep search across the codebase

**Shell commands**: Always require your approval before any command runs. The agent can propose commands but nothing executes until you confirm.

**Limitation**: Some operations require explicit scene/parent paths

**Impact**: AI may ask follow-up questions for clarity

**Benefit**: Ensures safe, predictable operations

### Model Selection

**What works**: All supported models work with Summer-specific tools

**Limitation**: Tool calls not available with reasoning models

**Workaround**: Switch to standard models for editor operations

## Performance

### Large Projects

**Supported**: Up to 50K files per project

**Performance**: Initial indexing may take 2-5 minutes for large projects

**Optimization**: Text files get full analysis, assets get metadata scanning

## Future Roadmap

### Short-term (next release)

- Real-time file watching (immediate index updates)
- Improved asset search and preview

### Medium-term

- Cross-project search and templates
- Visual asset understanding
- Advanced code generation and refactoring

## Support & Feedback

### If You Encounter Issues

- Check desktop console for `[RAG]` prefixed messages
- Try asking "explore my project structure" if search seems incomplete
- Report specific cases where AI can't find files you know exist

## Setting Expectations

### What Summer Excels At

- **Scene building** - Quickly assembling game objects and hierarchies
- **Property tweaking** - Adjusting values and configurations
- **Project exploration** - Understanding existing codebases
- **Learning assistance** - Explaining how things work in your project

### What Requires Manual Work

- **Complex scripting** - Use your preferred code editor for substantial coding
- **Asset creation** - Import and configure art, audio, and models manually
- **Performance optimization** - Profiling and optimization still needs hands-on work
- **Advanced engine features** - Shaders, plugins, and specialized systems

<Note>
Remember: Summer is designed to accelerate your workflow, not replace your expertise. It handles the tedious parts so you can focus on the creative and technical challenges that matter.
