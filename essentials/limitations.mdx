## Summer is in Active Development

Summer is currently in MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage. We're building toward becoming the most productive game development environment available. Here's what you can expect and what we're still working on.

<Warning>
This is MVP software - we're actively improving based on real usage patterns. Your feedback shapes the roadmap.
</Warning>

## Project Intelligence Limitations

### Project Index Sharing (Temporary)

**What it means**: Opening a new project will re-index and replace the previous project's search index

**Impact**: If you work on multiple projects, you'll need to wait for re-indexing when switching

**Workaround**: Work on one main project at a time for best performance

**Timeline**: Will be fixed in next release with proper project isolation

### File Discovery

**What works**: Finds all scripts, scenes, and assets in your project

**Limitation**: Re-indexes daily, not on every file save

**Impact**: Very new files might not appear in search immediately

**Workaround**: Ask the AI to "explore the project structure" to find recent files

## Authentication & Desktop Integration

### Authentication Flow

**What works**: One-time login, persistent across app restarts

**Limitation**: Login happens in embedded browser (some OAuth providers may block)

**Workaround**: Use email/password if OAuth fails

### File Operations

**What works**: Add nodes, set properties, connect signals, read any file

**Limitation**: Large file operations (>10MB) may be slow

**Impact**: AI will ask for confirmation before large operations

## AI Chat Features

### Tool Calls

**What works**: Editor operations, file reading, project exploration

**Limitation**: Some operations require explicit scene/parent paths

**Impact**: AI may ask follow-up questions for clarity

**Benefit**: Ensures safe, predictable operations

### Model Selection

**What works**: All supported models work with Summer-specific tools

**Limitation**: Tool calls not available with reasoning models

**Workaround**: Switch to standard models for editor operations

## Performance

### Large Projects

**Supported**: Up to 50K files per project

**Performance**: Initial indexing may take 2-5 minutes for large projects

**Optimization**: Text files get full analysis, assets get metadata scanning

## Feature Limitations

### What's Not Available Yet

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="x" title="Advanced import settings">
    Most asset import options need to be configured manually. AI can't modify importer settings yet.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="x" title="Large-scale refactoring">
    Cross-file refactoring and project-wide changes aren't supported in MVP.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="x" title="Plugin integration">
    Custom editor plugins may not work properly with AI operations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="x" title="Visual shader editing">
    Visual shader graphs can't be modified through AI yet.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="x" title="Animation timeline">
    Animation keyframes and timeline editing is manual-only for now.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### What Works Well

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Scene composition">
    Adding nodes, setting properties, organizing scene hierarchies works reliably.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Script attachment">
    Creating script stubs, attaching to nodes, opening in external editors.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Project settings">
    Input actions, project configuration, basic export settings.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="check" title="Signal connections">
    Connecting node signals with automatic method stub generation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Future Roadmap

### Short-term (next release)

- Project isolation (unique indexes per project)
- Real-time file watching (immediate index updates)
- Improved asset search and preview

### Medium-term

- Cross-project search and templates
- Visual asset understanding
- Advanced code generation and refactoring

## Support & Feedback

### If You Encounter Issues

- Check desktop console for `[RAG]` prefixed messages
- Try asking "explore my project structure" if search seems incomplete
- Report specific cases where AI can't find files you know exist

## Setting Expectations

### What Summer Excels At

- **Scene building** - Quickly assembling game objects and hierarchies
- **Property tweaking** - Adjusting values and configurations
- **Project exploration** - Understanding existing codebases
- **Learning assistance** - Explaining how things work in your project

### What Requires Manual Work

- **Complex scripting** - Use your preferred code editor for substantial coding
- **Asset creation** - Import and configure art, audio, and models manually
- **Performance optimization** - Profiling and optimization still needs hands-on work
- **Advanced engine features** - Shaders, plugins, and specialized systems

<Note>
Remember: Summer is designed to accelerate your workflow, not replace your expertise. It handles the tedious parts so you can focus on the creative and technical challenges that matter.
