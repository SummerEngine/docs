## Starting Your First Chat

Once you have Summer installed and a project open, you can start using AI to build your game.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the AI Chat">
    Click the chat icon in the toolbar or press `Ctrl+Shift+A` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+A` (macOS).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe what you want">
    Type a natural language description of what you want to add or change in your game.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and apply">
    Summer will show you what it plans to do. Click "Apply" to make the changes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Conversations

Here are some examples to get you started:

### Adding Objects

```
You: Add a red cube to the center of the scene
Summer: I'll create a MeshInstance3D with a BoxMesh and red material at position (0,0,0).
```

### Setting Properties

```
You: Make the player move twice as fast
Summer: I'll find your player script and increase the speed variable from 5.0 to 10.0.
```

### Creating Scripts

```
You: Add a health system to the player that starts at 100
Summer: I'll create a health.gd script with health = 100 and damage/heal functions.
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Be specific**: Instead of "make it better", try "increase the jump height" or "add a blue glow effect".
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Ask for explanations**: Add "and explain what you did" to understand the changes.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Review changes**: Always check what Summer did before continuing. Use Ctrl+Z to undo if needed.
</Warning>

## Understanding AI Responses

Summer will typically:

1. **Analyze** your request and current project state
2. **Plan** the specific changes needed
3. **Execute** the changes through the editor
4. **Explain** what was done and why

## Common Patterns

### Scene Manipulation
- "Add a [object] to the scene"
- "Move the [object] to [position]"
- "Scale the [object] by [factor]"

### Code Generation
- "Create a script that [does something]"
- "Add a function to [do something]"
- "Fix the bug where [describe issue]"

### Project Organization
- "Create a new scene for [purpose]"
- "Organize these nodes into groups"
- "Add this to the autoload"
