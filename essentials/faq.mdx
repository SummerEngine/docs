## What is Summer?

Summer is a **native fork of Godot** with built-in AI capabilities. It's not just Godot with a pluginâ€”it's Godot itself, enhanced with AI that understands your entire project and can modify scenes, code, and assets through natural language commands.

**Think of it as Cursor for game development.** Instead of juggling ChatGPT, VS Code, and Godot, you work in one unified environment.

## Is Summer Compatible with Godot?

**Yes, completely.** Since Summer is built from Godot's source code, it works with:
- All existing Godot projects
- All Godot tutorials and documentation
- All third-party libraries and plugins
- All community assets and tools
- All export templates (web, desktop, mobile)

You can open any Godot project in Summer and continue working on it immediately.

## What Makes Summer Different from Just Using Godot + ChatGPT?

**Unified Experience**: No switching between tools. AI understands your project context and can directly modify your game.

**Safe Operations**: AI changes go through Godot's APIs with full undo support. Nothing breaks unexpectedly.

**Specialist Agents**: Expert AI agents for 3D modeling, audio design, and complex technical challenges.

**Project Intelligence**: AI indexes and understands your entire codebase, scenes, assets, and relationships.

## Is Summer for Beginners or Professionals?

**Both, but it serves professionals best.** Summer is designed as a productivity tool that helps experienced developers work faster, similar to how Cursor helps programmers.

- **For Pros**: Cut development time by 50-80% while maintaining professional control
- **For Beginners**: Lower barrier to entry while teaching real Godot skills
- **For Teams**: Unified environment for collaboration

## How Good is the AI-Generated Art?

**Honest answer**: Good for prototyping, not production. AI art in Summer is designed for:
- Rapid concept exploration
- Placeholder assets during development
- Quick iteration on visual ideas

**What it's not good for**:
- Final production art
- Complex character designs
- Polished commercial visuals

All AI-generated assets are clearly labeled, and we strongly encourage using human artists for final production work.

## What About Privacy? Is My Code Safe?

**Privacy is a top priority.** We don't train AI models on user code, and Privacy Mode is enabled by default.

**What we do with your code**:
- Send it to AI models to generate responses to your questions
- Index it for project intelligence (understanding your codebase)
- Temporarily hold it during conversations
- Delete it when you're done

**What we never do**:
- Train AI models on your code
- Store your code permanently on our servers
- Share your code with other users or companies
- Sell access to your data
- Use your code for any purpose except helping you build games

**Privacy Policy**: For complete legal details about data handling and retention, see our full privacy policy.

## Which AI Models Does Summer Use?

Summer integrates with multiple AI providers to give you the best experience. You can choose which models to use for different tasks.

### Primary AI Models
**Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Anthropic)** - Primary model for code generation and project assistance
- Latest Claude model with superior reasoning for complex programming
- Best for game logic, debugging, and architecture decisions

**GPT-4o (OpenAI)** - Alternative model for code and creative tasks
- Most advanced GPT model with multimodal capabilities
- Excellent for creative problem-solving and documentation generation

**Gemini 1.5 Pro (Google)** - Additional model for code generation
- Strong at code completion and technical tasks
- Good for complex programming challenges

**Custom Summer Models** - Specialized models trained on game development
- Optimized for Godot-specific workflows
- Enhanced understanding of game development patterns

### Generation Models
**Meshy** - 3D model generation
- Text-to-3D and image-to-3D conversion
- Game-ready models with proper UV mapping

**ElevenLabs** - Voice and music generation
- High-quality voice acting for games
- Background music and sound effects
- Multiple voice styles and languages

**Gemini Flash 2.5 (Google)** - Image generation
- Fast, high-quality image creation
- Optimized for game art and concept visualization

**Sora 2 (OpenAI)** - Video cutscene generation
- AI-powered cinematic cutscenes
- High-quality video content for game narratives

**Other Providers** - Additional 3D and audio partners
- Integration with various AI generation services
- Expandable based on user needs and quality

### Model Selection
You can choose which models to use in Summer's settings:
- Switch between primary AI models based on your preferences
- Enable/disable specific generation providers
- Use your own API keys for supported services

**Default Settings**: Claude for primary assistance, Meshy for 3D, ElevenLabs for audio.

**Staying Current**: When new AI models are released, Summer typically integrates them within 24 hours to ensure you always have access to the latest capabilities.

## What's the Learning Curve?

**Moderate.** Summer takes practice to write effective prompts, but it's much easier than learning traditional game development from scratch.

**Best for**:
- People willing to learn game development
- Those who want to understand the underlying Godot concepts
- Developers who want to maintain control over their code

## Can I Make AAA Games with Summer?

**Not yet, and that's not our goal.** Summer is designed for indie games and small team development. We're building toward professional capabilities, but we're realistic about AI limitations for extremely complex projects.

**Current sweet spot**: Games that would take 1-7 years traditionally can be built in 3-12 months with Summer.

## What's the Development Timeline?

**We're in active development with clear milestones:**

- **Q1-Q2 2025**: Foundation building, improved AI accuracy
- **Q3-Q4 2025**: Professional features, team collaboration
- **2026**: Full production-ready capabilities

## Is Summer Free?

**Free to download and try.** We offer a free tier with core AI features. Premium features (advanced AI models, team collaboration) will be available through subscription.

## How Does Summer Compare to Other AI Game Tools?

**Summer is unique because it's a full game engine fork**, not just an AI addon. This means:
- Deeper integration with the development workflow
- Better understanding of project context
- More reliable and safe AI operations
- Full compatibility with existing Godot ecosystem

## What If I Have Existing Godot Projects?

**They work perfectly.** Just open them in Summer and continue development. All your scenes, scripts, assets, and plugins will work exactly as before, plus you get AI assistance.

## Do You Support Multiplayer Games?

**Yes, with limitations.** Basic multiplayer networking works with AI assistance. Advanced multiplayer features are still being developed.

## What's Your Refund Policy?

**30-day money-back guarantee** on all paid plans. If Summer doesn't help you build games faster, we'll refund your purchase.

## How Do I Get Support?

**Founders are directly accessible.** Email founders@summerengine.com for any questions, bugs, or feature requests. We're a small team and respond personally to every inquiry.

## What's Next for Summer?

**We're focused on becoming the most productive game development environment available.** Future features include:
- Advanced procedural generation
- Better team collaboration tools
- Improved AI accuracy and reliability
- Cross-platform optimization
- Professional asset pipelines

We're building Summer based on real developer feedback and usage patterns.
