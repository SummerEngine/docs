## Individual Plans

| Plan | Price | AI Usage | MCP Calls (weekly) |
|------|-------|----------|---------------------|
| **Hobby** | Free | Limited agent use + limited AI asset creations | 100/week |
| **Pro** | $20/mo | Extended agent usage + higher AI asset creation limits | 1M/week |
| **Pro+** | $60/mo | 3x Pro usage | 1M/week |
| **Ultra** | $200/mo | 10x Pro usage | 1M/week |

Yearly billing saves 20% on Pro, Pro+, and Ultra. All plans include Summer Agent (AI chat in the editor) and MCP tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.). Pro and above include asset search across our library.

## How usage works

### AI usage limits

AI usage is consumed when you use Summer Agent (chat, code generation, asset generation) or cloud MCP tools like asset search. Different models cost different amounts. View your usage in the [Dashboard](https://summerengine.com/dashboard) under **Spending**.

### MCP calls

MCP calls count when you use Summer Engine tools from Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, or the CLI. Each tool invocation (e.g. `summer_add_node`, `summer_set_prop`, `summer_play`) counts as one call. Local calls reset weekly.

## What happens when I reach my limit?

### When you reach your AI usage limit

When you exceed your included usage, you'll be notified in the editor and can choose to:

- **Add on-demand usage** — Continue using Summer at the same API rates with pay-as-you-go billing
- **Upgrade your plan** — Move to a higher tier for more included usage

On-demand usage is billed monthly. Requests are never downgraded in quality or speed. See [Account & Billing](/essentials/account-billing) for how to set spend limits.

### When you hit the MCP call limit (Free tier)

Free users get 100 MCP calls per week. When you reach the limit:

- Local MCP tools (scene editing, play/stop, diagnostics) stop working until the next week
- You'll see a message in your AI tool asking you to upgrade
- **Upgrade to Pro** for 1M calls per week
