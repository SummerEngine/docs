## Billing

### How do I access billing settings?

Access the billing portal through the [Dashboard](https://summerengine.com/dashboard) by clicking **Billing & Invoices** in the left sidebar. The **Spending** tab lets you view your plan, included usage, and on-demand settings. The **Manage** button opens Stripe's secure portal for payment method, subscription, and invoice management.

### What are Summer Engine's billing cycles?

Billing cycles run monthly, starting on your subscription date. Credits reset at renewal (no rollover). Free users get $10/month in credits. Pro ($20/mo), Pro+ ($60/mo), and Ultra ($200/mo) get plan credits that reset each cycle.

### Where can I find my invoices?

Find all billing history in the Stripe portal. Click **Manage** on the Spending page, then view and download current and past invoices from the portal.

### How do I update my billing information?

Update payment method, address, and tax information through the Stripe portal (opened via **Manage** on the Spending page). We use Stripe for secure transactions. Changes only affect future invoices.

### How do I cancel my subscription?

Cancel through the Billing & Invoices page by clicking **Manage subscription** then **Cancel subscription** in the Stripe portal. Access continues until the end of your current billing period.

### I'm having other billing issues. How can I get help?

For billing questions, email [founders@summerengine.com](mailto:founders@summerengine.com) from the email linked to your account. Include your account details and concerns.

## Spend Limits

Set spending limits to control costs and prevent unexpected charges. Spend limits help you manage usage and stay within budget.

Spend limits apply to **on-demand usage only**. Included usage in your plan does not count towards spend limits.

### Viewing spend limits

View your current spend limits in the [Dashboard](https://summerengine.com/dashboard) under the **Spending** tab.

On-demand usage must be enabled to view and set spend limits. Free users must upgrade to a paid plan first before they can enable on-demand.

### Updating spend limits

You can update spending limits at any time:

- **Increase limits**: Takes effect immediately
- **Decrease limits**: Takes effect immediately, but won't affect usage that has already occurred
- **Remove limits**: Set limit to "Unlimited" to remove on-demand limits

### Spend limit behavior

When your spending limit is reached:

- AI features stop working until the next billing cycle
- You see a notification indicating your limit was reached
- Usage resumes automatically at the start of the next billing cycle

### Individual plans

Customers with Pro, Pro+, and Ultra subscriptions can set monthly spend limits for on-demand usage. Free users must upgrade before enabling on-demand.
