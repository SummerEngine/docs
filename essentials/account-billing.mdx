## Billing & Subscription

### How do I access billing?

Access billing through the [Dashboard](https://summerengine.com/dashboard) — click **Billing** in the sidebar to view your subscription, update payment method, and see invoice history.

### Billing cycles

Billing runs monthly or annually, starting on your subscription date. You can switch between plans in the dashboard.

### How do I update my payment information?

Update your payment method, billing address, and tax information through the billing portal in the dashboard. We use Stripe for secure transactions.

### How do I cancel my subscription?

Cancel through the Dashboard → Billing page. Click **Manage subscription** → **Cancel subscription**. You'll keep access until the end of your current billing period.
