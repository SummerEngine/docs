### Alternative: Install via CLI

If you use Cursor, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible AI tool, you can install Summer Engine from the command line:

```bash
npx summer-engine install
```

This downloads and installs the engine to your system (macOS: `/Applications/Summer.app`, Windows: default install location). No npm global install required. `npx` runs it on demand. After install, run `npx summer-engine login` and `npx summer-engine run` to get started.

For MCP setup (connecting your IDE to Summer Engine), see [MCP Setup](/mcp/setup).
