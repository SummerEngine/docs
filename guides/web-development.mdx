## Overview

Summer excels at web-based game development, whether you're creating browser games, web-based tools, or hybrid applications. This guide covers best practices for web development workflows in Summer.

## Web Game Development

### HTML5 Game Export

Summer can help you prepare games for web deployment:

```
Configure my Godot project for HTML5 export
Set up the export template with proper threading settings
Optimize asset loading for web browsers
Add a loading screen with progress indication
```

### Browser Compatibility

Ensure your games work across different browsers:

```
Check this WebGL shader for compatibility with older browsers
Add fallbacks for browsers that don't support WebAssembly
Implement touch controls for mobile web browsers
Test audio loading across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
```

### Performance Optimization

Web games require special performance considerations:

```
Optimize texture sizes for faster web loading
Implement asset streaming for large games
Add compression to reduce download sizes
Create a progressive loading system for game assets
```

## Web Technologies Integration

### JavaScript Interop

Bridge between your game and web technologies:

```gdscript
## Interface with JavaScript for web-specific features
## Handles communication between Godot and browser APIs
class_name WebInterface extends Node

## Call JavaScript function from GDScript
func call_js_function(function_name: String, args: Array = []):
    if OS.has_feature("web"):
        JavaScriptBridge.eval(function_name + "(" + str(args) + ")")

## Receive data from JavaScript
func _ready():
    if OS.has_feature("web"):
        JavaScriptBridge.eval("window.godot_ready = true")
```

### Local Storage Integration

Manage web browser storage for save data:

```
Create a web-compatible save system using browser localStorage
Implement save data encryption for web deployment
Add cloud save synchronization for web players
Handle storage quota limits gracefully
```

### Web APIs Access

Integrate with browser APIs for enhanced functionality:

```
Add support for Gamepad API for web controller input
Implement fullscreen toggle using the Fullscreen API
Use the Web Audio API for advanced audio processing
Add support for drag-and-drop file uploads
```

## Development Workflow

### Live Development

Set up efficient web development workflows:

```
Configure Godot's built-in web server for testing
Set up automatic browser refresh on code changes
Create a debug overlay for web-specific information
Implement hot-reloading for faster iteration
```

### Cross-Platform Testing

Test across different platforms and browsers:

```
Create automated tests for different browser engines
Set up device testing for mobile web browsers
Implement feature detection for progressive enhancement
Add analytics to track browser compatibility issues
```

### Deployment Pipeline

Streamline your web deployment process:

```
Set up automated builds for web deployment
Configure CDN distribution for game assets
Implement cache busting for updated content
Add monitoring for web performance metrics
```

## Common Web Development Patterns

### Responsive Design

Create games that work on various screen sizes:

```
Implement responsive UI scaling for different screen sizes
Add touch-friendly controls for mobile browsers
Create adaptive quality settings based on device capabilities
Handle orientation changes gracefully
```

### Progressive Loading

Manage asset loading for better user experience:

```
Create a manifest system for asset dependencies
Implement priority loading for critical game assets
Add background loading for non-essential content
Show loading progress with estimated completion times
```

### Offline Support

Make games work without internet connection:

```
Implement service worker for offline gameplay
Cache critical game assets locally
Add offline detection and user feedback
Create a sync system for when connection returns
```

## Integration with Web Services

### Authentication

Integrate with web-based authentication systems:

```
Add OAuth integration for social login
Implement JWT token handling for API access
Create secure session management for web games
Add single sign-on support for web platforms
```

### Analytics and Metrics

Track player behavior and game performance:

```
Integrate Google Analytics for player tracking
Add custom event tracking for game-specific metrics
Implement A/B testing for game balance changes
Create performance monitoring for web deployment
```

### Monetization

Implement web-friendly monetization options:

```
Integrate with web-based payment systems
Add support for in-game advertising
Implement premium account features
Create subscription management for web users
```

## Best Practices

### Code Organization

Structure your web projects effectively:

```
web/
├── scripts/           # Web-specific GDScript files
├── assets/           # Web-optimized assets
├── templates/        # HTML templates
├── styles/           # CSS stylesheets
└── deployment/       # Build and deployment scripts
```

### Asset Management

Optimize assets for web delivery:

```
Use appropriate image formats (WebP, AVIF) for modern browsers
Implement fallbacks for older browsers
Compress audio files for faster loading
Create multiple resolution versions for different devices
```

### Error Handling

Handle web-specific errors gracefully:

```
Add network error handling for online features
Implement graceful degradation for missing features
Create user-friendly error messages for web issues
Add automatic retry logic for failed requests
```

## Testing and Debugging

### Browser Developer Tools

Leverage browser debugging capabilities:

```
Add console logging for web-specific debugging
Use browser performance profiler for optimization
Implement remote debugging for mobile browsers
Create debug commands accessible from browser console
```

### Automated Testing

Set up comprehensive testing for web deployment:

```
Create unit tests for web-specific functionality
Add integration tests for browser API usage
Implement visual regression testing for UI changes
Set up performance benchmarking for web builds
```

### User Testing

Gather feedback from web users:

```
Add in-game feedback collection system
Implement crash reporting for web deployment
Create user behavior tracking (with privacy considerations)
Set up beta testing programs for web users
```

## Deployment Strategies

### Static Hosting

Deploy to static hosting services:

```
Configure builds for GitHub Pages deployment
Set up automated deployment to Netlify
Create build scripts for AWS S3 hosting
Add custom domain configuration
```

### CDN Integration

Use content delivery networks for better performance:

```
Configure CloudFlare for global content delivery
Set up AWS CloudFront for asset distribution
Implement cache headers for optimal performance
Add geographic content optimization
```

### Continuous Deployment

Automate your deployment pipeline:

```
Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds
Create staging environments for testing
Implement blue-green deployment for zero downtime
Add rollback capabilities for failed deployments
```
