## How It Works

Summer automatically analyzes and indexes your project to understand:

- **Code structure** - Classes, functions, variables, and their relationships
- **Scene hierarchy** - Node trees, components, and connections
- **Asset relationships** - Textures, models, sounds, and where they're used
- **Project patterns** - Your coding style, naming conventions, and architecture

## Automatic Indexing

When you open a project, Summer:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scans all files">
    Analyzes scripts, scenes, resources, and project settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Builds knowledge graph">
    Creates connections between different parts of your project
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understands context">
    Learns your patterns and project-specific logic
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stays updated">
    Continuously updates as you make changes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Summer Knows

### Code Understanding
```gdscript
# Summer knows this is a player controller
extends CharacterBody3D
class_name Player

@export var speed: float = 5.0
@export var jump_velocity: float = 4.5

func _physics_process(delta):
    # Summer understands this handles movement
    handle_movement(delta)
```

When you ask "make the player faster", Summer knows:
- Which script controls the player
- That `speed` is the relevant variable
- How to modify it safely

### Scene Relationships
```
Main Scene
├── Player (CharacterBody3D)
│   ├── MeshInstance3D
│   └── CollisionShape3D
├── Environment
└── UI
    ├── HealthBar
    └── Score
```

Summer understands these connections and can:
- Add UI elements that reference the player
- Create enemies that target the player node
- Modify scenes while preserving relationships

## Smart Suggestions

Based on project analysis, Summer can suggest:

  <Card title="Performance Improvements" icon="gauge">
    "I noticed you're using get_node() in _process. Let me cache those references."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Best Practices" icon="lightbulb">
    "This signal connection could be done in the editor instead of code."
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bug Prevention" icon="shield">
    "Adding null checks here would prevent crashes when nodes are freed."

## Privacy & Performance

<Info>
**Local Processing**: All analysis happens on your machine. Your code never leaves your computer.
</Info>

<Info>
**Incremental Updates**: Only changed files are re-analyzed, keeping things fast.
</Info>

<Info>
**Smart Caching**: Summer remembers what it learned between sessions.
</Info>

## Customizing Intelligence

You can guide Summer's understanding:

### Project Comments
```gdscript
# SUMMER: This is the main game manager singleton
extends Node

# SUMMER: Handle player spawning and respawning
func spawn_player():
    pass
```

### Ignore Patterns
Create a `.summerignore` file:
```
# Don't analyze generated files
.import/
builds/
temp/

# Skip third-party code
addons/third_party/
```

## Working with Large Projects

For projects with thousands of files:

- **Prioritization**: Summer focuses on recently modified files
- **Selective indexing**: You can specify which folders are most important
- **Background processing**: Analysis happens without blocking your work
