## How AI Operations Work

Summer's AI can directly modify your project through safe, structured operations. All changes go through the editor's proper APIs and are fully undoable.

<Note>
Unlike free-form file editing, Summer uses specific operations that ensure your project stays stable and nothing breaks unexpectedly.
</Note>

## Scene Operations

The AI can modify your scenes through these operations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="plus" title="Add Nodes">
    **What it does**: Creates new nodes in your scene
    
    **Example prompts**:
    - "Add a CharacterBody2D named Player"
    - "Create a Button under the UI node"
    - "Add a CollisionShape2D to the Player"
    
    **How it works**:
    - AI specifies the parent node and node type
    - Node is created with a unique name
    - Automatically selected in the scene tree
    - Fully undoable with Ctrl+Z
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="settings" title="Set Properties">
    **What it does**: Changes node properties and values
    
    **Example prompts**:
    - "Set the Player's position to (100, 200)"
    - "Make the Button text say 'Start Game'"
    - "Change the sprite texture to player.png"
    
    **How it works**:
    - AI reads current property values
    - Sets new values through the inspector
    - Changes appear immediately in the editor
    - Each property change is undoable
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="link" title="Connect Signals">
    **What it does**: Connects node signals to methods
    
    **Example prompts**:
    - "Connect the Button's pressed signal to start_game"
    - "Wire up the player's body_entered signal"
    
    **How it works**:
    - AI finds the signal and target method
    - Creates the connection in the editor
    - Generates method stubs if needed
    - Opens external editor for code editing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Project Operations

AI can also modify project-level settings:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Project Settings">
    **What it does**: Changes project configuration
    
    **Example prompts**:
    - "Set the main scene to MainMenu.tscn"
    - "Add a new layer to the physics layers"
    - "Configure the window size to 1920x1080"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="keyboard" title="Input Actions">
    **What it does**: Manages input action mappings
    
    **Example prompts**:
    - "Add a 'jump' action mapped to Space"
    - "Create movement actions for WASD"
    - "Set up controller input for player 2"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Script Operations">
    **What it does**: Attaches scripts and opens editors
    
    **Example prompts**:
    - "Attach a script to the Player node"
    - "Open the player script in my editor"
    - "Create a new script for the UI manager"
    
    **Note**: For substantial code editing, Summer opens your external editor (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Reading Your Project

Before making changes, AI can read your project structure:

### Project Intelligence

- **File tree scanning** - AI sees all your scripts, scenes, and assets
- **Scene structure reading** - Understands node hierarchies and relationships  
- **Property inspection** - Reads current values before making changes
- **Script content** - Analyzes your existing code for context

### What This Enables

  <Card title="Context-Aware" icon="brain">
    References existing nodes, scripts, and assets in its responses
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Conflict Prevention" icon="shield">

  <Card title="Incremental Changes" icon="layers">

  </Card>
</Columns>

## Safety & Limitations

### What's Safe

- **All operations are undoable** - Standard Ctrl+Z works for everything
- **Editor APIs only** - No direct file manipulation that could corrupt projects
- **Explicit operations** - AI must specify exactly what it's changing
- **Immediate feedback** - Changes appear instantly in the editor

### Current Limitations

- **No batch file operations** - Large refactors across many files aren't supported yet
- **Limited import settings** - Asset import options are mostly manual for now
- **Scene-focused** - Works best with open scenes rather than project-wide changes

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="eye" title="Review changes">
    Always check what the AI plans to do before confirming operations. The change review panel shows exactly what will be modified.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="save" title="Save regularly">
    Save your scenes after AI makes changes you want to keep. This persists the changes to your project files.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="undo" title="Use undo freely">
    Don't hesitate to undo AI changes that aren't quite right. You can always ask for a different approach.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
