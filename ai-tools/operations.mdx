## Meet Your AI Game Development Team

Imagine having a team of expert game developers available 24/7 to help you build your game. That's what Summer's AI agents bring to your workflow.

### Your Personal Game Development Experts

**The 3D Specialist**
When you need help with complex 3D scenes, lighting setups, or material systems, ask Summer to create a 3D specialist:

```
"Hey Summer, can you create a 3D specialist agent to help me set up realistic lighting for my forest scene?"
```

This creates a dedicated conversation thread where an AI expert focuses entirely on your 3D challenges. They'll understand PBR materials, global illumination, and scene optimization.

**The Audio Specialist**
For immersive sound design, spatial audio, or complex mixing scenarios:

```
"Summer, please create an audio specialist agent to help me design the sound mix for my horror game."
```

Your audio specialist will guide you through creating atmospheric soundscapes, implementing 3D spatial audio, and optimizing audio performance.

### How Specialist Agents Work

Unlike regular chat where Summer handles everything, specialist agents are like bringing in a consultant for a specific job. They stay focused on their area of expertise and can dive deep into complex problems.

**Example Workflow:**
1. You: "Create a 3D specialist for my character animation system"
2. Summer creates a new conversation thread with the 3D specialist
3. You work with the specialist on detailed animation rigging, bone hierarchies, and IK setups
4. The specialist remembers your project's animation patterns from previous conversations
5. You return to your main chat when the animation work is complete

This keeps conversations focused and lets you build up expertise in different areas of your game.

### What Summer Can Build For You

Summer doesn't just talk about game development - it actively builds things in your project. Here's what it can create:

**Game Code That Works**
Summer writes production-ready GDScript that integrates with your existing codebase. Not just snippets, but complete systems:

- Character controllers with proper physics integration
- Inventory systems with UI and data persistence
- AI behaviors that work with your game's mechanics
- Network synchronization for multiplayer features

**Visual Assets You Need**
When you need game art but don't have an artist yet:

- UI textures and button graphics
- Environment backgrounds and tilesets
- Character sprites and animations
- Special effects and particle textures

**Audio That Fits Your Game**
Sound design that's tailored to your game's atmosphere:

- Background music that matches your game's mood
- Sound effects for specific game actions
- Ambient audio loops for different environments
- Voice acting prompts for professional recording

**Documentation That Helps**
Summer creates living documentation that stays current:

- Code comments that explain complex systems
- Design documents that capture your game vision
- Technical guides for your team members
- Player-facing content like tutorials and lore

### Summer's Knowledge Library

Think of Summer as having instant access to a vast game development library. When you're stuck on a technical problem, Summer can research and find the right solution.

**Built-in Godot Expertise**
Summer knows Godot inside and out. When you ask "How do I create a third-person camera that follows the player smoothly?", Summer doesn't guess - it knows the exact Camera3D setup, the right script structure, and the physics considerations.

**Real-Time Research**
Summer can search current tutorials, documentation, and community resources while you work. Need to implement a specific shader effect? Summer finds the latest examples and adapts them to your project.

**Learning From Your Code**
Summer analyzes your existing code patterns and suggests improvements. If you have a consistent way of handling player input, Summer learns that pattern and applies it to new features.

**Context-Aware Help**
Unlike generic AI that gives broad advice, Summer understands your specific game. When you ask for help with collision detection, Summer looks at how you've implemented it elsewhere in your project and gives tailored advice.

### Working Directly in Your Project

Summer doesn't just suggest changes - it can implement them directly in your Godot project. This means you can describe what you want and see it appear in your game.

**Safe File Operations**
Summer creates and modifies files with care. When you ask Summer to "add a health system to my player", it:

1. Creates a new script file with the health logic
2. Adds the necessary variables and functions
3. Connects it to your existing player scene
4. Sets up any required UI elements

**Smart Project Understanding**
Summer knows how your project is organized. It understands:
- Which scenes connect to which scripts
- How your assets are structured
- What naming conventions you use
- How your game's systems work together

**Seamless Asset Integration**
When Summer generates an asset for you (like a texture or sound), it automatically places it in the right folder and connects it to your scenes. No manual importing required.

**Undo-Able Everything**
Every change Summer makes can be undone with Ctrl+Z. If something doesn't work as expected, you can instantly revert it and try a different approach.

## Reading Your Project

Before making changes, AI can read your project structure:

### Project Intelligence

- **File tree scanning** - AI sees all your scripts, scenes, and assets
- **Scene structure reading** - Understands node hierarchies and relationships  
- **Property inspection** - Reads current values before making changes
- **Script content** - Analyzes your existing code for context

</Columns>

## Safety & Limitations

### What's Safe

- **All operations are undoable** - Standard Ctrl+Z works for everything
- **Editor APIs only** - No direct file manipulation that could corrupt projects
- **Explicit operations** - AI must specify exactly what it's changing
- **Immediate feedback** - Changes appear instantly in the editor

### Current Limitations

- **No batch file operations** - Large refactors across many files aren't supported yet
- **Limited import settings** - Asset import options are mostly manual for now
- **Scene-focused** - Works best with open scenes rather than project-wide changes

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="eye" title="Review changes">
    Always check what the AI plans to do before confirming operations. The change review panel shows exactly what will be modified.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="save" title="Save regularly">
