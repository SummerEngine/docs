## Meet Your AI Game Development Team

Imagine having a team of expert game developers available 24/7 to help you build your game. That's what Summer's AI agents bring to your workflow.

### Your Personal Game Development Experts

**The 3D Specialist**
When you need help with complex 3D scenes, lighting setups, or material systems, ask Summer to create a 3D specialist:

```
"Hey Summer, can you create a 3D specialist agent to help me set up realistic lighting for my forest scene?"
```

This creates a dedicated conversation thread where an AI expert focuses entirely on your 3D challenges. They'll understand PBR materials, global illumination, and scene optimization.

**The Audio Specialist**
For immersive sound design, spatial audio, or complex mixing scenarios:

```
"Summer, please create an audio specialist agent to help me design the sound mix for my horror game."
```

Your audio specialist will guide you through creating atmospheric soundscapes, implementing 3D spatial audio, and optimizing audio performance.

### How Specialist Agents Work

Unlike regular chat where Summer handles everything, specialist agents are like bringing in a consultant for a specific job. They stay focused on their area of expertise and can dive deep into complex problems.

**Example Workflow:**
1. You: "Create a 3D specialist for my character animation system"
2. Summer creates a new conversation thread with the 3D specialist
3. You work with the specialist on detailed animation rigging, bone hierarchies, and IK setups
4. The specialist remembers your project's animation patterns from previous conversations
5. You return to your main chat when the animation work is complete

This keeps conversations focused and lets you build up expertise in different areas of your game.

### What Summer Can Build For You

Summer doesn't just talk about game development - it actively builds things in your project. Here's what it can create:

**Game Code That Works**
Summer writes production-ready GDScript that integrates with your existing codebase. Not just snippets, but complete systems:

- Character controllers with proper physics integration
- Inventory systems with UI and data persistence
- AI behaviors that work with your game's mechanics
- Network synchronization for multiplayer features

**Visual Assets You Need**
When you need game art but don't have an artist yet:

- UI textures and button graphics
- Environment backgrounds and tilesets
- Character sprites and animations
- Special effects and particle textures

**Audio That Fits Your Game**
Sound design that's tailored to your game's atmosphere:

- Background music that matches your game's mood
- Sound effects for specific game actions
- Ambient audio loops for different environments
- Voice acting prompts for professional recording

**Documentation That Helps**
Summer creates living documentation that stays current:

- Code comments that explain complex systems
- Design documents that capture your game vision
- Technical guides for your team members
- Player-facing content like tutorials and lore

### Summer's Knowledge Library

Think of Summer as having instant access to a vast game development library. When you're stuck on a technical problem, Summer can research and find the right solution.

**Built-in Engine Expertise**
Summer knows the engine inside and out. When you ask "How do I create a third-person camera that follows the player smoothly?", Summer doesn't guess—it knows the exact Camera3D setup, the right script structure, and the physics considerations.

**Real-Time Research**
Summer can search current tutorials, documentation, and community resources while you work. Need to implement a specific shader effect? Summer finds the latest examples and adapts them to your project.

**Learning From Your Code**
Summer analyzes your existing code patterns and suggests improvements. If you have a consistent way of handling player input, Summer learns that pattern and applies it to new features.

**Context-Aware Help**
Unlike generic AI that gives broad advice, Summer understands your specific game. When you ask for help with collision detection, Summer looks at how you've implemented it elsewhere in your project and gives tailored advice.

### Working Directly in Your Project

Summer doesn't just suggest changes—it can implement them directly in your project. This means you can describe what you want and see it appear in your game.

**Safe File Operations**
Summer creates and modifies files with care. When you ask Summer to "add a health system to my player", it:

1. Creates a new script file with the health logic
2. Adds the necessary variables and functions
3. Connects it to your existing player scene
4. Sets up any required UI elements

**Smart Project Understanding**
Summer knows how your project is organized. It understands:
- Which scenes connect to which scripts
- How your assets are structured
- What naming conventions you use
- How your game's systems work together

**Seamless Asset Integration**
When Summer generates an asset for you (like a texture or sound), it automatically places it in the right folder and connects it to your scenes. No manual importing required.

**AI Asset Import**
Summer imports assets from Summer Studio directly into your project. Describe what you need (a low-poly tree, a wooden crate, footsteps on gravel) and Summer searches the store, picks a match, downloads it, and runs the import pipeline. The asset appears in your project and is ready to place in your scene. No copy-paste, no manual download, no wondering where the file went.

For scenes that need many assets at once (a village, a forest, a city block), Summer supports bulk import. It plans the full set, downloads and imports everything in one batch, runs a single filesystem scan, and tells you when it is done. One wait instead of many. Your computer may lag briefly during large imports, but you get a heads-up first. The assets are there when Summer needs them, and it can start placing them in your scene right away.

**Undo-Able Everything**
Every change Summer makes can be undone with Ctrl+Z. If something doesn't work as expected, you can instantly revert it and try a different approach.

## Reading Your Project

Before making changes, AI can read your project structure:

### Project Intelligence

- **File tree scanning** - AI sees all your scripts, scenes, and assets
- **Scene structure reading** - Understands node hierarchies and relationships  
- **Property inspection** - Reads current values before making changes
- **Script content** - Analyzes your existing code for context

  </Card>
</Columns>

## Tools, search & execution

### Shell commands require approval

**All shell commands require your approval before they run.** The agent can suggest commands (e.g. run tests, install dependencies, run scripts), but nothing executes until you explicitly approve it. This keeps your system safe and gives you full control over what runs.

### Grep search

Summer uses **grep-style search** (ripgrep) across your codebase for faster, more precise discovery. The agent can find code patterns, symbols, and references without loading entire files, which improves both search quality and performance.

### Glob file discovery

Summer can **find files by pattern** (e.g. `*.gd`, `**/scripts/*.tscn`). When the AI needs to discover which files exist before reading or editing, it uses glob to quickly list matching paths. This is faster than scanning the full tree when you know the file type or location pattern.

### Code editing tools

Summer chooses the right edit tool for each job: **strReplace** for small, surgical changes (rename a variable, fix a typo, swap a snippet) and **replaceText** for larger edits that touch many lines. The AI reads your file first, then applies changes with the most efficient tool.

### Infrastructure (Vercel)

Search and AI infrastructure runs on **Vercel**. Where applicable, services are hosted in the EU for privacy and low latency. This is already implemented and in use.

### Expert queue

The **expert queue** lets the agent hand off work to specialist subagents in order. Instead of one agent doing everything, tasks can be queued for the right expert (e.g. 3D, audio, debugging). The main agent stays in control; experts do the deep work and report back.

### Subagents

The agent can **spawn subagents**: specialized background assistants that run in their own context. Summer uses them automatically to rapidly research your codebase (the **Explore** agent) or execute complex multi-step tasks (the **General Purpose** agent) in parallel. You can watch subagents work live in the chat via an interleaved transcript of their thoughts and tool usage, keeping the main conversation clean while they handle the heavy lifting. See [Subagents](/ai-tools/subagents) for how they work and when to use them.

## Safety & Limitations

### What's Safe

- **All operations are undoable** - Standard Ctrl+Z works for everything
- **Editor APIs only** - No direct file manipulation that could corrupt projects
- **Explicit operations** - AI must specify exactly what it's changing
- **Immediate feedback** - Changes appear instantly in the editor

### Current Limitations

- **No batch code refactors** - Large refactors across many files are not supported yet (bulk asset import is supported)
- **Limited import settings** - Asset import options are mostly manual for now
- **Scene-focused** - Works best with open scenes rather than project-wide changes

### Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
