## Our Commitment to Security

At Summer, we understand that your code is your most valuable asset. We've built our security infrastructure with developer privacy and data protection as core principles, not afterthoughts.

## Data Handling Philosophy

**Your Code, Your Control**: We believe developers should have full transparency and control over how their code is handled. Every decision we make prioritizes your privacy and security.

## Infrastructure Security

We depend on the following trusted partners and services, organized by how they interact with your data:

### Core Infrastructure

**Vercel** - *Sees and stores code data*  
Our primary infrastructure is hosted exclusively on Vercel's EU-based servers, ensuring GDPR compliance and providing enhanced privacy protection for all users.

**Vercel AI Gateway** - *Sees code data*  
We use Vercel AI Gateway as a proxy to improve performance and security for our AI API requests.

### AI Model Providers

**Anthropic** - *Sees code data*  
We use Claude models for AI responses. Code may be sent to Anthropic for processing. We have a zero data retention agreement with Anthropic.

**OpenAI** - *Sees code data*  
We use GPT models for certain AI features. Code may be sent to OpenAI for processing. We have a zero data retention agreement with OpenAI.

**Google Cloud Vertex API** - *Sees code data*  
We use Gemini models through Google's Vertex API. We have a zero data retention agreement with Google Cloud Vertex.

### Data Storage and Processing

**Turbopuffer** - *Stores obfuscated code data*  
Embeddings of indexed codebases and obfuscated metadata are stored with Turbopuffer on Google Cloud servers in the US. This enables Summer's project intelligence features. You can read more on [Turbopuffer's security page](https://turbopuffer.com/docs/security).

**Supabase** - *Stores code data*  
We use Supabase for user data, project metadata, and art assets. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

### Essential Services (No Code Access)

**Stripe** - *No code data*  
Handles billing and payments. Only stores your payment information and billing details.

**Vercel** - *Sees and stores code data*  
Hosts our primary infrastructure including API servers. Code data passes through Vercel's infrastructure during processing.

**Amplitude** - *No code data*  
Analytics for usage patterns only. No code data is stored - only events like "AI request made" or "project opened".

**Slack & Google Workspace** - *May store code snippets for debugging*  
Our internal communication tools. We may share non-sensitive code snippets for debugging purposes, but never full codebases or sensitive information.

**Sentry** - *May store code data in error reports*  
Error monitoring and performance tracking. Code data may appear in error logs but is never explicitly sent.

## Geographic Data Handling

- **Primary servers**: European Union (exclusively via Vercel EU)
- **AI processing**: United States (AI model providers only)
- **No Chinese infrastructure**: We do not use any Chinese companies as subprocessors
- **Data residency**: All primary infrastructure and data processing occurs within EU boundaries
- **GDPR compliance**: EU-based infrastructure ensures full GDPR compliance by design

## Access Controls

### Team Access
- **Least privilege principle**: Team members only access systems necessary for their role
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Required for all infrastructure access
- **Network controls**: Restricted access using both network-level and secret-based controls
- **Regular audits**: Periodic review of access permissions and usage

### Your Control
- **Project privacy settings**: Control who can see your projects
- **Data deletion**: Request deletion of your data at any time
- **Access logs**: View when and how your data has been accessed
- **Export capabilities**: Download your project data in standard formats

## Data Protection Measures

### Encryption
- **In transit**: All data encrypted with TLS 1.3
- **At rest**: Database and file storage encrypted
- **End-to-end**: Sensitive operations use additional encryption layers

### Privacy by Design
- **Minimal data collection**: We only collect data necessary for functionality
- **Purpose limitation**: Data is only used for stated purposes
- **Data minimization**: Regular cleanup of unnecessary data
- **Anonymization**: Personal identifiers removed where possible

### Compliance
- **GDPR compliance**: Full compliance with European data protection regulations through EU-based infrastructure
- **CCPA compliance**: California Consumer Privacy Act compliance
- **EU data residency**: Primary infrastructure hosted exclusively in the European Union
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Currently in progress (expected completion Q2 2026)
