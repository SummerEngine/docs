## Why Test Exported Builds?

Your game might work perfectly in the Summer Engine editor but have issues when exported. **Always test exported builds** before releasing to players!

<Warning>
  **Critical difference**: Some features work differently (or only work) in exported builds:
  - Microphone permissions (macOS)
  - Performance characteristics
  - File paths and resource loading
  - Platform-specific features
</Warning>

This guide shows you how to properly test your game **after export** but **before release**.

---

## Quick Testing Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export Your Game">
    Follow the [macOS export](/publishing/macos-export) or [Windows export](/publishing/windows-export) guide
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test on Your Development Machine">
    First smoke test - does it launch and run?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test on a Clean Machine">
    **Critical!** Test on different computer to catch distribution issues
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fix Issues and Re-export">
    Make changes in Summer Engine, export again, repeat
  </Step>
</Steps>

## macOS Local Testing

### First Run: Ad-Hoc Signing

Summer Engine creates **ad-hoc signed** builds by default. These work on your Mac but have security dialogs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export Your Game">
    **Project → Export → macOS**
    
    Configure minimum settings:
    - **Bundle Identifier**: `com.yourgame.test` (any reverse-domain format)
    - **Codesign → Codesign**: **Disabled** or **Built-in (ad-hoc only)**
    - **Notarization → Notarization**: **Disabled**
    
    Click **Export Project** → Save as `~/Desktop/YourGame.app`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch the Exported Game">
    Navigate to Desktop → Double-click `YourGame.app`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Handle Security Dialog">
    **First launch**: macOS shows "unidentified developer" warning
    
    **To bypass**:
    - Right-click (don't double-click!) `YourGame.app`
    - Click **Open** from menu
    - Click **Open** in the dialog
    
    <img src="/images/publishing/macos-security-warning.png" alt="macOS security dialog" />
    
    <Note>
      This is **normal for local testing**! You're using ad-hoc signing, not production signing.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Permissions">
    If your game uses microphone, camera, or other features:
    
    macOS will ask for permissions on **first launch** of the exported app
    
    This is **good** - it means your game can access hardware in exported builds!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Why the Security Warning Appears

**Ad-hoc signed apps** (for testing):
- ✅ Run on your Mac
- ✅ Request permissions properly
- ✅ Perfect for development testing
- ❌ Other people's Macs will block them (Gatekeeper)

**Properly signed apps** (for distribution):
- ✅ Run on anyone's Mac
- ✅ No security warnings
- ❌ Require Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- ❌ Not needed for Steam/itch.io (platforms handle it)

<Tip>
  **For local testing**: Ad-hoc signing is perfect! Only get proper signing when you're ready to distribute outside Steam/itch.io.
</Tip>

## Testing Features That Only Work in Exports

### Microphone/Audio Input

**Why it matters**: Voice chat, voice commands, audio recording

**In editor**: May not request permissions properly (macOS security limitation)

**In export**: ✅ macOS permission dialog appears on first launch

**How to test**:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Export and Launch">
    Export game → Right-click Open → Click Open in dialog
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger Mic Usage">
    Start your game's voice feature (voice chat, recording, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant Permission">
    macOS shows: *"YourGame would like to access the microphone"*
    
    Click **OK**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify It Works">
    - Speak into mic
    - Check audio input is captured
    - Test your voice features work properly
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Check System Settings**:
- After granting permission, verify in **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone**
- Your game should appear in the list ✅

### Camera Access

Similar process to microphone - permission dialog appears on first use in exported build.

### File System Access

**Save games and user data**:
- **In editor**: Saves to project folder usually
- **In export**: Saves to `~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/YourGame/`

**Test**:
1. Save game in exported build
2. Quit game
3. Launch again - verify save loaded

---

## Windows Local Testing

### No Security Warnings on Your PC

Windows trusts your own builds by default. But test what **other users** will see:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export for Windows">
    **Project → Export → Windows Desktop**
    
    Export to `MyGame.exe`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Launch">
    Double-click `MyGame.exe` - should run immediately
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test on Friend's PC">
    Copy `MyGame.exe` to another Windows PC
    
    **They'll see**: Windows Defender SmartScreen warning
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Users See (Unsigned Windows Build)

**First launch on clean PC**:

1. Double-click `MyGame.exe`
2. **Windows Defender SmartScreen** appears:
   > "Windows protected your PC. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting."

**How to bypass** (show in your game's README):
1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**
3. Game launches

<Info>
  **This is normal for unsigned games!** itch.io players are used to this. Steam removes the warning automatically.
  
  Only code sign if you're doing **direct downloads** outside Steam/itch.io.
</Info>

## Performance Testing

### Test Debug vs Release

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Debug Export (For Testing)">
    **When to use**: During development, need console output
    
    **Characteristics**:
    - Shows debug messages in console
    - 30-50% slower than release
    - Larger file size
    - Includes debug symbols
    
    **Good for**: Finding bugs, checking logs
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Release Export (For Distribution)">
    **When to use**: Final distribution to players
    
    **Characteristics**:
    - Full optimization enabled
    - Smaller file size
    - No console output
    - Maximum performance
    
    **Good for**: Final release, performance testing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**How to switch**:
- Export preset → **Debug → Export Console Wrapper**
- **Debug Only**: Includes console in debug builds
- **No**: No console in any builds (release mode)

<Tip>
  **Test workflow**: Export as Debug during testing (see errors), then export as Release for final performance check before publishing.
</Tip>

### Framerate Testing

**Check FPS in exported build**:
1. Enable FPS display in your game (or use external tools)
2. Run through demanding scenes
3. Verify maintains target FPS (30 or 60)

**If slow**:
- Profile in editor first (Debug → Profiler)
- Optimize before exporting
- Lower graphics settings in Project Settings

---

## Testing on Clean Machines

### Why This Matters

**Your dev machine has**:
- Summer Engine installed
- All dependencies
- Your project files
- Visual C++ runtimes
- Ideal testing environment

**User's machine has**:
- Nothing except the OS
- Might be missing runtimes
- Different GPU/drivers
- Real-world conditions

**Common issues only found on clean machines**:
- Missing DLL files (Windows)
- Graphics driver incompatibilities
- Audio device issues
- Save file path problems

### How to Test on Clean Machine

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Use a Friend's Computer">
    **Easiest option**: Send your exported game to a friend
    
    Steps:
    1. Export your game
    2. Copy to USB drive or upload to Google Drive/Dropbox
    3. Friend downloads and runs it
    4. Watch them play (screen share if remote)
    5. Note any errors or issues
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Virtual Machine">
    **For thorough testing**: Create clean Windows/Mac VM
    
    Tools:
    - **macOS**: UTM (free), Parallels ($100/year)
    - **Windows**: VMware, VirtualBox (free)
    
    Steps:
    1. Install clean OS in VM
    2. Copy your exported game to VM
    3. Run and test
    4. VM can be reset to clean state for repeated testing
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Different User Account">
    **Quick option**: Create new user account on your Mac/PC
    
    Steps:
    1. System Settings → Users → Add new user
    2. Log in as that user (fresh environment)
    3. Copy and test your game
    4. Closer to real user experience than your dev account
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Voice Feature Testing (Special Case)

If your game uses **microphone input** (voice chat, voice commands):

### The Editor Problem

**Issue**: Running Summer Engine editor as a bare binary **doesn't** trigger macOS microphone permissions properly.

**Result**: Voice features may appear broken in editor but work fine in exported builds.

### The Solution: Test Via Export

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export Your Game">
    Create macOS export preset (ad-hoc signing is fine)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch Exported .app">
    Right-click → Open → Open
    
    **Not** launching via editor's "Run" button!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trigger Voice Feature">
    Join voice chat, speak command, or start recording
  </Step>

  <Step title="Permission Dialog Appears">
    macOS shows: *"YourGame would like to access the microphone"*
    
    ✅ This is **correct behavior** - means it will work for players!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Grant and Test">
    Click **OK** → Test voice features work properly
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Voice features cannot be fully tested in the editor** due to macOS security restrictions on bare binaries.
  
  Always export and test voice features in the exported .app build!
</Warning>

## Fixing Issues Found During Testing

### Game Crashes on Launch

**Debug process**:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Export in Debug Mode">
    Change **Debug → Export Console Wrapper** to **Debug Only**
    
    Re-export your game
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch from Terminal">
    ```bash
    # macOS
    ~/Desktop/YourGame.app/Contents/MacOS/YourGame
    
    # Windows (Command Prompt)
    C:\Users\You\Desktop\YourGame.exe
    ```
    
    Errors will print to terminal
  </Step>

  <Step title="Read Error Messages">
    Look for:
    - Missing file errors
    - Script errors
    - Resource loading failures
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fix in Summer Engine">
    Fix the issue in your project, re-export, test again
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Graphics Issues (Missing Textures, Pink Materials)

**Possible causes**:
1. Texture compression not enabled for platform
2. Shaders not exported properly
3. Resources not included in export

**Solution**:
1. Verify texture compression enabled (ETC2 ASTC for Mac, S3TC BPTC for Windows)
2. Check **Export → Resources → Export Mode** is **"Export all resources in project"**
3. Re-export and test

### Audio Not Playing

**Check**:
1. Audio files are Ogg Vorbis or WAV (MP3 works but has licensing issues)
2. AudioStreamPlayer nodes properly configured
3. Audio bus not muted
4. Test with headphones (not just speakers)

---

## Testing Different Architectures (macOS)

macOS has **three architecture options** - each needs testing if you support it:

### Universal (Recommended)

**What it is**: Single app that runs on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs

**How to test**:
- Test on **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1/M2/M3)
- Test on **Intel Mac** (if you have access)

**If you only have one Mac type**: Ask a friend with the other type to test!

### arm64 Only

**What it is**: Apple Silicon only (smaller file size)

**How to test**: Runs on M1/M2/M3 Macs only

**Will NOT run on**: Intel Macs (shows error)

### x86_64 Only (Legacy)

**What it is**: Intel Macs only

**How to test**: Runs on Intel Macs

**On Apple Silicon**: Runs via Rosetta 2 (translation layer) - slower performance

<Info>
  **For Steam/itch.io**: Use **universal** to support maximum players. File size difference is minimal (~20% larger) but compatibility is worth it.
</Info>

---

## Testing Save Data

### Where Saves Go

**In editor**:
- Usually `user://` folder maps to project directory
- Easy to find and debug

**In exported game**:
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/YourGameName/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Godot\app_userdata\YourGameName\`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/YourGameName/`

### Test Save Persistence

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Save Data">
    Launch exported game → Save your progress
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quit Completely">
    Fully quit the game (don't just close window)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Relaunch">
    Open game again
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Save Loaded">
    Check that your progress/settings persisted
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Common save issues**:
- Using wrong directory (hardcoded paths instead of `user://`)
- Not calling `save()` on File object
- File permissions issues on different OS

---

## Performance Testing

### Compare Editor vs Export

**Expected**: Exported game runs **faster** than editor (especially Release builds)

**If exported game is slower**:
- Check you're using **Release** export, not Debug
- Profile in editor first (Debug → Profiler) - find bottlenecks before exporting
- Test on same machine for fair comparison

### Minimum Spec Testing

**Test on lower-end hardware**:
- Older Mac (Intel i5)
- Budget Windows PC
- Integrated graphics (Intel/AMD iGPU, not dedicated GPU)

**Check**:
- Maintains target FPS (30 or 60)
- No stuttering during gameplay
- Memory usage stays reasonable (< 4 GB for most indie games)

<Tip>
  **Can't test on low-end hardware?** 
  
  In Project Settings: **Rendering → Quality** - set to "Low" and test. If it runs well on your dev machine at Low quality, it'll run OK on budget PCs at similar settings.
</Tip>

---

## Platform-Specific Testing

### macOS Specific

**Test these features**:
- [ ] Retina display rendering (high DPI)
- [ ] Fullscreen vs windowed mode
- [ ] Menu bar integration (if using native menus)
- [ ] Dock icon appears correctly
- [ ] Microphone permissions (if using voice)
- [ ] Trackpad gestures (if supported)

**Test on both**:
- macOS Sonoma (14.x) - latest
- macOS Ventura (13.x) - common version

### Windows Specific

**Test these features**:
- [ ] DirectX 11 rendering
- [ ] Fullscreen exclusive mode
- [ ] Alt+Tab works properly
- [ ] Multiple monitor support
- [ ] Windows 10 AND Windows 11

**Common Windows-only bugs**:
- Path separators (`/` vs `\`)
- Case-sensitive file names (works on Mac, breaks on Windows)
- Missing Visual C++ Runtime (should be bundled)

---

## Multiplayer Testing

If your game has multiplayer (voice chat, co-op, etc.):

### Local Network Testing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export for Both Platforms">
    Build Mac version and Windows version (or same platform twice)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test on Same Network">
    - Computer A runs one build
    - Computer B runs another build
    - Connect them together (LAN multiplayer)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Voice Chat">
    If using voice:
    - Verify audio transmits clearly
    - Check proximity audio works (if applicable)
    - Test push-to-talk vs always-on
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Gameplay">
    - Movement syncs correctly
    - Actions sync (shooting, jumping, etc.)
    - No severe lag on local network
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Internet Testing

**Test over real internet** (not just LAN):
- Use cloud server or dedicated server
- Test with friend in different location
- Check for latency issues
- Verify voice quality over internet connection

---

## What to Look For During Testing

### Red Flags (Fix Before Release)

🚩 **Crashes within first 5 minutes** - major stability issue
🚩 **Missing textures/audio** - resource export problem
🚩 **Stuttering/freezing** - performance issue
🚩 **Save doesn't persist** - save system broken
🚩 **Controls don't work** - input mapping issue

### Minor Issues (Fix If Time Permits)

⚠️ **Occasional visual glitch** - note and fix if easy
⚠️ **One sound effect too loud** - balance issue
⚠️ **Typo in UI text** - polish issue
⚠️ **Minor FPS dip in one area** - optimize if possible

### What's OK to Ship

✅ **Security warnings on macOS/Windows** - normal for unsigned games on itch.io
✅ **Console window appears briefly** (Windows Debug mode) - disable for final release
✅ **Not 100% perfect graphics** - indie games are judged on gameplay
✅ **Small bugs you know about** - can patch after release if noted

<Tip>
  **Perfection is the enemy of shipping.** Fix critical bugs, polish what you can, then release! You can always update after launch based on player feedback.
</Tip>

## Common Testing Mistakes

### ❌ Only Testing on Development Machine

**Problem**: Works for you, crashes for users

**Solution**: Test on at least one other computer

### ❌ Only Testing Debug Builds

**Problem**: Debug is slow, users get Release build

**Solution**: Always test final Release build before publishing

### ❌ Skipping Platform-Specific Testing

**Problem**: Works on Mac, crashes on Windows (or vice versa)

**Solution**: Test every platform you're releasing on

### ❌ Not Testing Permissions

**Problem**: Microphone/camera don't work for users

**Solution**: Test exported build specifically for permission dialogs

### ❌ Assuming Editor = Export

**Problem**: Different behaviors in editor vs export

**Solution**: **Always export and test** before considering game "done"
