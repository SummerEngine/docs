## Overview

Windows is the **largest PC gaming market**. This guide walks you through creating a Windows build of your game.

**Time to complete**: 10-15 minutes (first time)

<Info>
  Good news: Windows export is simpler than macOS! No bundle identifiers or code signing complexities (unless you want them).
</Info>

## Prerequisites

### Enable S3TC BPTC Texture Compression

Windows graphics cards use S3TC/BPTC texture compression.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    Go to **Project → Project Settings** in the menu bar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Textures">
    **Rendering → Textures → VRAM Compression**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable S3TC BPTC">
    Toggle **Import S3TC BPTC** to **On**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Reimport">
    Summer will reimport all textures (1-5 minutes)
    
    Progress shown in bottom status bar. **Keep Summer open** during this.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Also releasing on Mac?** Enable **Import ETC2 ASTC** too. Both formats can coexist - just enable them both at once to avoid re-importing twice.
</Tip>

## Creating a Windows Export Preset

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Export Menu">
    Go to **Project → Export** in the menu bar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Windows Preset">
    Click **Add...** → Select **Windows Desktop**
    
    You'll see the Windows export configuration panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Windows is simpler than Mac - most defaults work fine!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Recommended Settings

**Binary Format**:
- **Architecture**: `x86_64` ✅ (64-bit, modern Windows)
  - Don't use `x86_32` (32-bit) unless you have a specific reason
  - 64-bit supports more RAM and is standard for games

**Embed PCK**:
- **On** ✅ - Creates single `.exe` file (easier distribution)
- **Off** - Creates `.exe` + `.pck` file (slightly faster loading)

<Info>
  **For Steam and itch.io**: Use **Embed PCK: On** for single-file distribution. Players prefer downloading one file.
</Info>

**Debug Settings**:
- **Export Console Wrapper**: 
  - **Debug Only** ✅ - Recommended for testing (shows console output in test builds)
  - **No** - For final release
  - **Debug and Release** - If you want console output in released game

**Application**:
- **Icon**: (Optional) Browse to a `.ico` file for your game's Windows icon
- **Company Name**: Your studio name
- **Product Name**: Your game's name  
- **File Description**: Brief game description
- **Copyright**: Copyright text (e.g., "© 2024 Your Studio")

## Exporting Your Windows Game

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Export Path">
    Click the folder icon next to **Export Path**
    
    Choose where to save (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\MyGame.exe`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Export Project">
    Bottom right: **Export Project...**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Export">
    Takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes. Progress bar shows status.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Done!">
    Your Windows game is ready!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Windows Build

### Test on Your PC First

1. Navigate to export location
2. Double-click `MyGame.exe`
3. **If Windows Defender SmartScreen appears**:
   - Click **More info**
   - Click **Run anyway**
   - This is normal for unsigned executables

<Note>
  The SmartScreen warning appears because your game isn't code signed. This is **normal** during development and for itch.io releases. Steam-distributed games don't show this warning.
</Note>

### Test on a Different Windows PC

**Critical for catching issues!** Test on:
- ✅ A friend's PC
- ✅ A clean Windows install (virtual machine works)
- ✅ Windows 10 AND Windows 11 (if possible)

**What to verify**:
- Game launches without errors
- Graphics render correctly
- Audio works (no crackling or silence)
- Controls work (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
- Windowed and fullscreen modes work
- Save files persist after closing

---

## Code Signing (Optional)

Code signing removes the Windows Defender SmartScreen warning. **Do you need it?**

| Publishing To | Code Signing Recommended? |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Steam** | ❌ No - Steam handles it |
| **itch.io** | ❌ No - Players expect unsigned indie games |
| **Direct download** | ✅ Yes - Improves trust, prevents warnings |

### How to Code Sign (Advanced)

**Requirements**:
- EV Code Signing Certificate (~$400/year from DigiCert, Sectigo, etc.)
- `signtool.exe` (included with Windows SDK)

**Process**:
1. Export your game as `.exe`
2. Sign the exe with `signtool`:
   ```powershell
   signtool sign /f "YourCert.pfx" /p "password" /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 MyGame.exe
   ```
3. Distribute the signed exe

<Warning>
  Code signing is **expensive** ($400/year minimum). Only worth it if you're doing **direct downloads** (not Steam/itch.io).
  
  For your first game release, **skip code signing** and use Steam or itch.io instead.
</Warning>

## Export Formats

Summer Engine can export Windows games in different formats:

### Single Executable (Recommended)
- **Export as**: `MyGame.exe`
- **Embed PCK**: On
- **Best for**: Steam, itch.io, direct downloads
- **Players get**: One file to run

### Executable + Data Pack
- **Export as**: `MyGame.exe`
- **Embed PCK**: Off
- **Best for**: Faster loading times (minor difference)
- **Players get**: `MyGame.exe` + `MyGame.pck` (must keep both files together)

### ZIP Archive
- **Export as**: `MyGame.zip`
- **Best for**: Manual distribution
- **Contains**: All game files in compressed archive

<Tip>
  **For most games**: Use single executable with Embed PCK enabled. It's the most user-friendly option.
</Tip>

## Common Windows-Specific Issues

### "VCRUNTIME140.dll not found"

**Cause**: Missing Visual C++ Runtime on user's PC.

**Solution**:
- Most Windows PCs already have this
- For clean installs, users can download from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
- Summer Engine exports include these by default

### Graphics Not Working

**Possible causes**:
- Outdated GPU drivers
- Missing DirectX 11 (Windows 7/8)
- Integrated Intel GPU (may need settings adjustment)

**Solution**: Have users update GPU drivers from manufacturer website.

### Game Runs Slowly on Windows

**Check**:
- Are you running in Debug mode? Export as **Release** for final version
- Is the user's PC below minimum specs?
- Profile performance in editor first (Debug → Profiler)

---

## File Size Optimization

**Typical Windows export sizes**:
- Small 2D: 60-120 MB
- Medium 3D: 220-450 MB
- Large 3D: 600 MB - 2 GB

**Summer Engine runtime on Windows**: ~70MB

**To reduce size**:
1. **Compress audio**: Use Ogg Vorbis instead of WAV
2. **Optimize textures**: Ensure S3TC BPTC is enabled (you did this!)
3. **Remove debug symbols**: Export as Release, not Debug
4. **Strip unused resources**: Clean unused assets from project before export
