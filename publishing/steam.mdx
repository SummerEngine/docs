## Overview

Steam is the **largest PC gaming platform** with 120+ million active users. This guide walks you through uploading your Summer Engine game to Steam.

**Prerequisites**:
- Exported game builds for your target platforms ([macOS](/publishing/macos-export), [Windows](/publishing/windows-export))
- Steamworks developer account
- $100 Steam Direct fee (one-time per game)

---

## Before You Begin: Steamworks Setup

### 1. Create Steam Partner Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up">
    Visit [Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/) and create an account
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete Tax Forms">
    Required by Valve for revenue distribution (W-8/W-9 forms)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pay Steam Direct Fee">
    $100 per game (one-time, recouped after $1,000 in sales)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create App">
    Click **Create New App** in Steamworks dashboard
    
    Fill in basic info (game name, description, genre)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The Steam Direct fee is **refundable** after your game makes $1,000 in sales. It's Valve's anti-spam measure.
</Info>

### 2. Configure Your Steam Store Page

Before uploading builds, set up your store page:
- Game description (short and long)
- Screenshots (at least 5)
- Trailer video (highly recommended)
- Pricing and release date
- Supported languages
- System requirements

**You can do this while developing** - store pages can be "Coming Soon" for wishlists.

## Uploading Your Game to Steam

### Understanding Steam Depots

Steam uses "depots" for different platform builds:

- **Windows Depot** - Your `MyGame.exe` build
- **macOS Depot** - Your `MyGame.app` build  
- **Linux Depot** - Your `MyGame.x86_64` build

Each depot is uploaded separately but players download the right one automatically.

### Upload Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Steamworks SDK">
    Download from [Steamworks SDK page](https://partner.steamgames.com/downloads/list)
    
    Extract to a convenient location (e.g., `~/SteamworksSDK/`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Build Scripts">
    Navigate to `SteamworksSDK/tools/ContentBuilder/scripts/`
    
    Edit `app_build_<appid>.vdf`:
    ```vdf
    "appbuild"
    {
      "appid" "YOUR_STEAM_APP_ID"
      "desc" "v1.0.0 Release"
      "buildoutput" "../output/"
      "contentroot" "../../content/"
      "setlive" "default"
      
      "depots"
      {
        "WINDOWS_DEPOT_ID" "scripts/depot_build_windows.vdf"
        "MAC_DEPOT_ID" "scripts/depot_build_mac.vdf"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Depot Scripts">
    Edit `depot_build_windows.vdf`:
    ```vdf
    "DepotBuildConfig"
    {
      "DepotID" "YOUR_WINDOWS_DEPOT_ID"
      "ContentRoot" "C:\path\to\your\exported\windows\build\"
      "FileMapping"
      {
        "LocalPath" "*"
        "DepotPath" "."
        "recursive" "1"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Repeat for Mac depot pointing to your `MyGame.app`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload Build">
    Run the upload tool:
    ```bash
    # Windows
    steamcmd +login YOUR_STEAM_USERNAME +run_app_build ../scripts/app_build_<appid>.vdf +quit
    
    # macOS
    ./steamcmd.sh +login YOUR_STEAM_USERNAME +run_app_build ../scripts/app_build_<appid>.vdf +quit
    ```
    
    Enter your Steam password when prompted.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Upload">
    Check Steamworks dashboard → **Builds** tab
    
    You should see your uploaded build with all depots listed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Build Live">
    In Steamworks: **Builds → Set Build Live on Branch**
    
    Select `default` branch for public release, or `beta` for testing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Test your Steam build** before setting it live! Use the `beta` branch first, download through Steam, and verify everything works.
</Warning>

## Steam Features Integration (Optional)

Summer Engine supports Steamworks integration for advanced features:

### GodotSteam Plugin

[GodotSteam](https://godotsteam.com/) is a community plugin that adds:
- ✅ Achievements
- ✅ Leaderboards  
- ✅ Steam Cloud saves
- ✅ Steam Input (controller support)
- ✅ Steam Overlay
- ✅ Multiplayer matchmaking

**How to add**:
1. Download GodotSteam from [godotsteam.com](https://godotsteam.com/)
2. Extract to your project's `addons/` folder
3. Enable in **Project → Project Settings → Plugins**
4. Follow GodotSteam docs for achievement/leaderboard setup

<Info>
  GodotSteam works **identically** in Summer Engine - all Godot Steam tutorials apply directly.
</Info>

---

## Platform-Specific Configuration

### Windows Build Settings

**Binary Format → Embed PCK**: ✅ **On**
- Creates single `.exe` file (easier for Steam)
- Slightly slower loading than separate `.pck` (negligible for most games)

**Debug → Export Console Wrapper**:
- **Debug Only** - For testing (console window shows debug output)
- **No** - For final release (no console window)

**Application → Product Name**: Your game's name as shown in Task Manager

### macOS Build Settings

**Binary Format → Architecture**: `universal` ✅
- Supports both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- Slightly larger file size but maximum compatibility

**Application → Bundle Identifier**: Set your unique ID (e.g., `com.yourstudio.yourgame`)

<Tip>
  Use the **same bundle identifier** across all your game versions (Mac, iOS if applicable). This is important for cloud save continuity.
</Tip>

### Linux Build (Steam Deck)

**Binary Format → Architecture**: `x86_64`
- Steam Deck uses this architecture
- **Export → Texture Format**: Use S3TC BPTC (same as Windows)

**Steam Deck Optimization**:
- Test UI at 1280x800 resolution (Steam Deck native)
- Support controllers (Steam Input handles this)
- Optimize for ~3-4 hours battery life

## Launch Options in Steamworks

After uploading, configure launch options in Steamworks:

### Windows Launch Options
```
Executable: MyGame.exe
Working Dir: (leave blank)
Arguments: (leave blank unless needed)
```

### macOS Launch Options
```
Executable: MyGame.app/Contents/MacOS/MyGame
Working Dir: (leave blank)
Arguments: (leave blank)
```

<Warning>
  macOS launch path must point **inside** the .app bundle to the actual executable, not just the .app itself!
</Warning>

### Linux Launch Options
```
Executable: MyGame.x86_64
Working Dir: (leave blank)
Arguments: (leave blank)
```

## Testing Your Steam Build

### Use Steam Beta Branch

Before releasing publicly, test with beta builds:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload to Beta Branch">
    In Steamworks: Set your build live on `beta` branch (not `default`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Beta">
    In Steam client:
    - Right-click your game → Properties
    - Betas tab → Select `beta` branch
    - Steam downloads your beta build
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Everything">
    - Launch the game through Steam
    - Test achievements (if using GodotSteam)
    - Verify cloud saves work
    - Test Steam Overlay (Shift+Tab)
    - Check controller support
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fix Issues and Re-upload">
    If you find bugs, fix in Summer Engine, re-export, and upload again to beta branch
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Final Release Checklist

Before setting your build live on `default` branch:

- [ ] Tested on Windows 10 **and** Windows 11
- [ ] Tested on macOS (if shipping Mac build)
- [ ] All graphics render correctly
- [ ] Audio plays without issues
- [ ] Controllers work (if game supports them)
- [ ] Achievements unlock properly (if applicable)
- [ ] Cloud saves persist (if using Steam Cloud)
- [ ] Game can be quit properly (doesn't hang)
- [ ] No console window in release build (Windows)
- [ ] Store page complete (description, screenshots, trailer)

## Updating Your Game on Steam

Players love games that get updates! Here's how:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fix/Add Features in Summer">
    Make changes to your game, test in editor
  </Step>

  <Step title="Re-Export">
    Export fresh builds for all platforms
  </Step>

  <Step title="Upload New Build">
    Use same ContentBuilder process with new build files
    
    Update the `desc` field to version number (e.g., "v1.1.0 - Bug fixes")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Live">
    Set new build live on `default` branch
    
    Steam automatically pushes update to all players!
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Best practices**:
- Include patch notes in Steamworks (players see what's new)
- Test updates on beta branch first
- Don't push broken builds to default - use beta testing!

## Common Steam Issues

### Build Won't Upload

**Error**: "Invalid content root" or "Files not found"

**Solution**: Check that `ContentRoot` in your depot scripts points to the **exact** location of your exported build.

### Players Can't Download Build

**Cause**: No build set live on default branch, or wrong platform depot

**Solution**: 
- Verify build is set live in Steamworks → Builds
- Check that Windows depot has Windows build, Mac depot has Mac build

### Achievement Not Unlocking

**Cause**: Achievement wasn't configured in Steamworks, or GodotSteam integration issue

**Solution**:
- Configure achievements in Steamworks first
- Use GodotSteam's achievement test functions
- Check Steam overlay is enabled

---

## Steam Distribution Fees

**Revenue Split**:
- Steam takes **30%** of all sales
- You receive **70%** of revenue

**Example**:
- Game price: $20
- Player buys game: $20 to Steam
- You receive: $14 (after 30% cut)
- After recouping $100 Steam Direct fee: All profit is yours

**Payment Schedule**: Monthly via direct deposit or wire transfer
