## DIY Console Porting (Advanced)

If you **do** get platform approval and want to port yourself:

### General Requirements

1. **Dev kit hardware** (per platform)
2. **Platform SDK** access
3. **Summer Engine source** with console modules enabled
4. **Compliance testing** (age ratings, content guidelines)
5. **Performance optimization** (consoles have fixed specs)

### Summer Engine Console Export

Once you have SDK access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Summer Team">
    Email founders@summerengine.com with:
    - Proof of platform approval
    - Which console(s) you're targeting
    - Your game's name and genre
  </Step>

  <Step title="We'll Provide">
    - Console-specific build instructions
    - Export configuration help
    - Engine modifications if needed (console-specific optimizations)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build and Test">
    Follow platform-specific build process
    
    Test on actual dev kit hardware (not emulators)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit to Platform">
    Submit build through platform's publishing portal
    
    Wait for certification (2-6 weeks)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **We cannot provide SDK files or bypass platform NDAs.** You must be approved by Nintendo/Sony/Microsoft independently.
  
  We can only help with Summer Engine-specific export configuration after you have legal SDK access.
</Warning>

## Console Certification Process

Each platform has strict requirements:

### Technical Requirements
- **Performance**: Maintain 30 or 60 FPS (platform-dependent)
- **Memory limits**: Stay within console RAM constraints
- **Controller support**: Full gamepad support required (no keyboard/mouse)
- **Save data**: Follow platform save system guidelines
- **Suspend/resume**: Handle sleep mode correctly

### Content Requirements
- **Age rating**: ESRB, PEGI ratings required before publishing
- **Content policy**: No prohibited content per platform rules
- **Localization**: May require multiple language support
- **Accessibility**: Some platforms require accessibility features

### Compliance Testing
- Submit build to platform's QA team
- Wait for certification results
- Fix any failed tests
- Re-submit until approved

**Timeline**: Budget **2-6 months** from dev kit to published game (experienced devs can be faster).

## Age Ratings (Required for Console)

All console games need official age ratings:

**ESRB** (North America):
- Application fee: ~$3,000-$4,000 depending on revenue tier
- Fill out content questionnaire
- Provide gameplay footage
- Rating assigned: E, E10+, T, M, AO

**PEGI** (Europe):
- Similar process and cost to ESRB
- Ratings: 3, 7, 12, 16, 18

**IARC** (International):

## Should You Release on Consoles?

### Good Reasons to Target Consoles
- ✅ Game is well-suited for controllers
- ✅ You have budget for dev kits and ratings ($5k-$15k)
- ✅ You have time for 6-12 month process
- ✅ Game has already succeeded on PC/mobile (proven concept)
- ✅ Genre fits console market (platformers, roguelikes, cozy games)

### Reasons to Wait
- ❌ First game ever - **release on PC/itch.io first**
- ❌ Limited budget - dev kits and ratings are expensive
- ❌ PC-focused genre (RTS, complex strategy)
- ❌ Game requires keyboard/mouse
- ❌ Still in early development - validate on PC first

<Tip>
  **Most successful indie devs** release on **PC/itch.io/Steam first**, validate the market, **then** port to consoles once they have revenue and proven demand.
  
  Don't rush to consoles - build your audience on accessible platforms first!
</Tip>

## Alternative: Console-First Publishers

Some publishers **specialize in bringing indie games to console**:

**How it works**:
1. You release your game on PC/Steam first
2. Publisher sees your game's success
3. Publisher approaches you (or you pitch to them)
4. They fund console ports in exchange for revenue share

**Examples**: Devolver Digital, Annapurna Interactive, Raw Fury

**Advantages**:
- ✅ They pay for everything (dev kits, ratings, marketing)
- ✅ You keep working on the game
- ✅ Professional QA and optimization
- ✅ Marketing and PR support

**Disadvantages**:
- 📉 Lower revenue share (30-50% to publisher)
- 📅 You don't control timeline
- 🎯 They're selective (need proven PC success first)

---

## Realistic Advice

### For Your First Game
**Focus on PC** (Windows/Mac/Linux) and **itch.io** or **Steam**:
- Much faster to market (weeks vs months)
- Cheaper ($0 for itch.io, $100 for Steam vs $5k+ for consoles)
- Easier to iterate based on player feedback
- Build your audience and credibility

### Once You Have a Hit
**Then consider consoles**:
- You'll have revenue to fund dev kits and ratings
- You'll have proven the game concept works
- You can hire porting studio or get publisher interest
- Platform holders are more likely to approve (proven track record)

<Tip>
  **Success path**: Release on PC → Get good reviews and sales → Use that revenue and validation to fund console ports
  
  Trying to launch on all platforms simultaneously is **extremely difficult** and **expensive** for indie devs. Start small, grow strategically!
</Tip>
