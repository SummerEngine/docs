## Overview

This guide walks you through exporting your Summer Engine game for macOS. Whether you're targeting Steam, itch.io, or direct distribution, the export process is the same.

**Time to complete**: 10-15 minutes (first time)

## Prerequisites

### Enable ETC2 ASTC Texture Compression

Apple Silicon Macs (M1, M2, M3 chips) require ETC2/ASTC texture format.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    Go to **Project → Project Settings** in the menu bar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Textures">
    **Rendering → Textures → VRAM Compression**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable ETC2 ASTC">
    Toggle **Import ETC2 ASTC** to **On**
    
    <img src="/images/publishing/enable-etc2-astc.png" alt="Enable ETC2 ASTC" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Reimport">
    Summer will reimport all textures (1-5 minutes depending on project size)
    
    You'll see progress in the bottom status bar. **Do not close Summer** during this process.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  **Also releasing on Windows?** Enable **Import S3TC BPTC** at the same time. This covers both Mac and Windows with one reimport.
</Tip>

## Creating a macOS Export Preset

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Export Menu">
    Go to **Project → Export** in the menu bar
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add macOS Preset">
    Click **Add...** → Select **macOS (Runnable)**
    
    You'll see the export configuration panel appear.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Required Settings">
    You'll see some warnings in red at the bottom. Let's fix them:
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Fix: Invalid Bundle Identifier

<Warning>
  You'll see: **"Invalid Bundle Identifier (com.example.game). The Bundle Identifier should be a valid domain name in reverse..."**
</Warning>

**What is this?** A bundle identifier is a unique name for your app in reverse-domain format.

**Examples**:
- `com.yourstudio.yourgame` (most common)
- `com.yourname.dontpray`
- `io.itch.username.gamename`

**How to fix**:
1. In the export panel, find **Application → Bundle Identifier**
2. Replace `com.example.game` with your unique identifier
3. Use only lowercase letters, numbers, dots, and hyphens
4. Must start with `com.`, `org.`, `io.`, or similar

<Tip>
  **Don't have a domain?** Use `io.itch.yourusername.yourgame` or `com.yourname.yourgame`. It just needs to be unique to you.
</Tip>

### Other Important Settings

**Application Section**:
- **Icon**: (Optional) Browse to a `.icns` or high-res `.png` file for your game icon
- **Signature**: Leave as default (`????`) unless you have a specific 4-character code
- **Short Version**: Leave empty to use project version
- **Copyright**: (Optional) Add your copyright text

**Export Section**:
- **Distribution Type**: 
  - **Testing** (default) - For local testing and itch.io
  - **Distribution** - For Steam and signed releases
  - **App Store** - Only if publishing to Mac App Store

**Binary Format**:
- **Architecture**: 
  - `universal` ✅ **Recommended** - Works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
  - `arm64` - Apple Silicon only (M1/M2/M3) - smaller file size
  - `x86_64` - Intel Macs only (legacy, not recommended)

<Info>
  For Steam or itch.io, use **universal** architecture to support the widest audience.
</Info>

## Exporting Your Game

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Export Path">
    Click the folder icon next to **Export Path**
    
    Choose where to save your game (e.g., `~/Desktop/MyGame.app`)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click Export Project">
    Bottom right button: **Export Project...**
    
    Summer will create your standalone Mac app!
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Export">
    Export takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on project size.
    
    You'll see a progress bar. **Don't close Summer** during export.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export Complete!">
    Your game is now a standalone `.app` file ready to distribute!
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Your Exported Game

**Critical**: Always test on a clean machine before releasing to players!

### Test on Your Mac First

1. Navigate to where you exported (e.g., Desktop)
2. Double-click `MyGame.app`
3. **If you see "unidentified developer" warning**:
   - Right-click the app → **Open**
   - Click **Open** in the dialog
   - This is normal for unsigned apps during testing

### Test on Someone Else's Mac

<Warning>
  **Do NOT skip this step!** Your game might work on your dev machine but crash on clean systems.
</Warning>

What to test:
- ✅ Game launches without errors
- ✅ Graphics render correctly
- ✅ Audio plays properly
- ✅ Controls respond (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
- ✅ Save/load works
- ✅ Game can be quit normally

**Found a bug?** Fix it in Summer Engine, then re-export. Exported games don't update automatically.

## What About Code Signing?

Code signing prevents "unidentified developer" warnings on macOS. **Do you need it?**

| Publishing To | Code Signing Required? | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Steam** | ❌ No | Steam handles signing for you automatically |
| **itch.io** | ❌ No | Indie game players expect unsigned games |
| **Direct download** (your website) | ✅ **Yes, highly recommended** | Without it, users see scary warnings |
| **Mac App Store** | ✅ **Required** | Cannot publish without Apple Developer account |

### How to Code Sign (Advanced)

If you need code signing for direct distribution:

**Requirements**:
- Apple Developer account ($99/year)
- Developer ID Application certificate
- Xcode Command Line Tools

**In Summer Engine**:
1. Export settings → **Codesign → Codesign**: Select **Xcode codesign**
2. **Codesign → Identity**: Enter your Developer ID certificate name
3. **Notarization → Notarization**: Select **altool** or **notarytool**
4. Provide Apple ID and app-specific password

<Info>
  This is **advanced** and only needed for direct downloads. If you're publishing to Steam or itch.io first, skip code signing entirely.
</Info>

## Common Issues

### "No export template found"

**This shouldn't happen** with Summer Engine! Templates are included.

**If you see this**: Contact support at founders@summerengine.com - something went wrong with your installation.

### "Cannot export for universal or arm64 if ETC2 ASTC is disabled"

**Solution**: Go back to **Prerequisites** section above and enable ETC2 ASTC texture compression.

### "Invalid Bundle Identifier"

**Solution**: Set a proper bundle identifier (see **Fix: Invalid Bundle Identifier** section above).

## File Size Tips

**Typical Mac export sizes**:
- Small 2D game: 50-150 MB
- Medium 3D game: 200-500 MB  
- Large 3D game with cinematics: 1-3 GB

**To reduce size**:
- Compress audio as Ogg Vorbis (not WAV)
- Use appropriate texture compression (you already enabled this!)
- Remove unused assets from your project
- Enable **Embed PCK** to avoid separate `.pck` file
