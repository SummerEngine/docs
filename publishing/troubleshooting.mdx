## Common Export Errors

### "No export template found at the expected path"

**What it means**: Summer Engine can't find the runtime files needed to create standalone games.

**Solution**: This **shouldn't happen** with Summer Engine - templates are included by default.

**If you see this**:
1. Check: **Editor → Manage Export Templates**
2. Should show templates installed for version `4.5.beta`
3. **If missing**: Contact support@summerengine.com - this indicates an installation issue

<Warning>
  Unlike vanilla Godot, Summer Engine **includes export templates**. If they're missing, something went wrong with your Summer Engine installation.
</Warning>

### "Cannot export for universal or arm64 if ETC2 ASTC texture format is disabled"

**What it means**: You're trying to export for Apple Silicon Macs without the required texture compression format.

**Solution**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Project Settings">
    **Project → Project Settings**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Texture Compression">
    **Rendering → Textures → VRAM Compression → Import ETC2 ASTC**
    
    Toggle to **On**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for Reimport">
    Summer will reimport all textures (1-5 minutes)
    
    Status bar shows progress
  </Step>

  <Step title="Try Export Again">
    Return to **Project → Export** and try exporting
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Why this happens**: Apple Silicon Macs use different texture compression than Intel Macs/PCs.

### "Cannot export for universal or x86_64 if S3TC BPTC texture format is disabled"

**What it means**: You're trying to export for Windows/Intel Macs without the required texture format.

**Solution**: Same as above, but enable **Import S3TC BPTC** instead of (or in addition to) ETC2 ASTC.

**Pro tip**: Enable **both formats at once** if you're releasing on both Mac and Windows. Avoids reimporting twice.

---

### "Invalid Bundle Identifier"

**Platform**: macOS only

**What it means**: You're using the default placeholder (`com.example.game`) which isn't valid for distribution.

**Solution**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Export Preset">
    **Project → Export** → Select your macOS preset
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Bundle Identifier">
    Scroll to **Application → Bundle Identifier**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Replace with Unique ID">
    Use reverse-domain format:
    - `com.yourstudio.yourgame`
    - `io.itch.username.gamename`
    - `com.yourname.projectname`
    
    Must be lowercase, use dots to separate, no spaces
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Preset is now valid for export!
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Why it matters**: macOS uses bundle identifiers to track apps. Without a unique one, your game might conflict with other apps or not install properly.

## Export Process Issues

### Export Takes Forever

**Normal times**:
- Small game (100 MB): 30-60 seconds
- Medium game (500 MB): 1-3 minutes
- Large game (2 GB): 5-10 minutes

**If taking longer**:
- Check disk space (need 2-3x game size free)
- Close other resource-heavy apps
- First export is slower (building pak files) - subsequent exports faster

### Export Crashes Summer Engine

**Possible causes**:
- Out of memory (exporting huge game)
- Corrupted asset in project
- Disk full

**Solution**:
1. Save your project
2. Restart Summer Engine
3. Check **Output** tab for error messages before exporting
4. Try exporting to a different location (different drive)

### Exported Build Is Missing Files

**Cause**: Files not properly added to export or excluded by filters

**Solution**:
- Check **Resources** tab in export preset
- Ensure **Export Mode** is **Export all resources** (not "selected resources")
- Verify **Filters to export** doesn't exclude needed files

## Runtime Issues (Exported Game Problems)

### Game Won't Launch After Export

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Windows: 'VCRUNTIME140.dll not found'">
    **Cause**: Missing Visual C++ Runtime
    
    **Solution**: Most PCs have this. If not, download from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
    
    Summer Engine exports **should** include this automatically - contact support if issue persists.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="macOS: 'App is damaged and can't be opened'">
    **Cause**: Unsigned app downloaded from internet
    
    **Solution for players**: Right-click app → **Open** → Click **Open** in dialog
    
    **Solution for developers**: Code sign your app (requires Apple Developer account)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Linux: Permission Denied">
    **Cause**: Executable not marked as executable
    
    **Solution**: 
    ```bash
    chmod +x MyGame.x86_64
    ./MyGame.x86_64
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="All Platforms: Crashes on Launch">
    **Debugging steps**:
    1. Run from terminal/command line to see error messages
    2. Check if it works on your dev machine
    3. Verify export architecture matches OS (arm64 for Apple Silicon, x86_64 for Intel/AMD)
    4. Test with minimal project - does export work with empty project?
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Graphics Issues in Exported Game

**Black screen or missing textures**:
- ✅ Check texture compression is enabled for target platform
- ✅ Verify shaders work in editor before exporting
- ✅ Test on GPU different from your dev machine
- ✅ Check minimum macOS/Windows version in export settings

**Low FPS after export**:
- Export in **Release** mode, not Debug
- Check **Project Settings → Rendering → Quality** - lower settings if needed
- Profile in editor first (Debug → Profiler) to find bottlenecks

### Audio Issues in Exported Game

**No sound or crackling**:
- ✅ Test audio works in editor first
- ✅ Check audio format (Ogg Vorbis recommended, not WAV)
- ✅ Verify user's PC has audio drivers installed
- ✅ Test with both speakers and headphones

## Platform-Specific Warnings

### macOS: "Unidentified Developer" Warning

**This is normal for unsigned apps!**

**What players see**:
> "MyGame.app cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"

**How players bypass it**:
1. Right-click the app (don't double-click)
2. Click **Open** from menu
3. Dialog appears with **Open** button
4. Click **Open** - app launches

**Permanent fix**: Code sign your app (requires Apple Developer account - $99/year)

**Alternative**: Publish on Steam - Steam handles signing for you

### Windows: SmartScreen Warning

**What players see**:
> "Windows protected your PC. Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting."

**How players bypass it**:
1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**

**Permanent fix**: Code sign with EV certificate ($400/year)

**Alternative**: Publish on Steam or itch.io - users expect this from indie games

<Info>
  **Don't worry about these warnings for itch.io releases!** Indie game players are used to clicking through them. Steam removes them automatically.
</Info>

## File Size Issues

### Exported Game Is Huge

**Check these**:
- Using WAV audio instead of Ogg Vorbis? (WAV is 10x larger)
- Uncompressed textures? (Enable S3TC/ETC2 compression)
- Debug symbols included? (Export as Release, not Debug)
- Unused assets in project? (Clean up before export)

**Compression comparison**:
- WAV audio (1 minute): ~10 MB
- Ogg Vorbis (1 minute): ~1 MB
- Uncompressed texture (1024x1024): ~4 MB
- Compressed texture (1024x1024): ~200 KB

### Exported Game Is Too Small (Missing Assets)

**Possible causes**:
- Export filters excluding your files
- Resources not saved in project
- Embed PCK disabled + you only distributed .exe (need both .exe and .pck)

**Solution**: Check Export preset → Resources tab → Export mode is **Export all resources**

---

## Performance Problems After Export

### Game Runs Slowly in Exported Build

**Check**:
1. Are you exporting in **Debug** mode? (Huge performance impact)
   - Solution: Export as **Release**
2. Is V-Sync enabled? (Limits to 60 FPS)
   - Project Settings → Rendering → V-Sync
3. Profile in editor first
   - Debug → Profiler → Find bottlenecks before exporting

**Debug vs Release performance**:
- Debug mode: 30-50% slower (includes debug symbols, checks)
- Release mode: Full speed optimization

### Game Crashes After Running for a While

**Possible causes**:
- Memory leak (check if RAM usage grows over time)
- Unhandled errors in game code
- Resource loading issues

**Debugging**:
1. Enable console output (Windows: Export Console Wrapper = On)
2. Run exported game and watch for error messages
3. Fix issues in Summer Engine code, re-export

---

## Steam-Specific Issues

### Build Uploaded But Players Can't Download

**Cause**: Build not set live on default branch

**Solution**:
- Steamworks dashboard → **Builds** tab
- Select your build → **Set build live on default branch**

### Wrong Version Downloading

**Cause**: Multiple builds on different branches

**Solution**: Check which branch is set as **default** in Steamworks

### macOS Build Won't Run Through Steam

**Cause**: Incorrect launch executable path

**Solution**: Set launch executable to:
```
MyGame.app/Contents/MacOS/MyGame
```

Not just `MyGame.app` - must point to binary **inside** the bundle!

---

## itch.io-Specific Issues

### Upload Fails

**File size limits**:
- Free account: 1 GB per file
- Paid account ($10/month): 2 GB per file

**Solution**: Compress your build or split into multiple files if over limit

### Web Game Doesn't Load

**For HTML5 exports**:
- Ensure you zipped the **entire export folder**, not just index.html
- Set correct index file (`index.html`)
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Some browser features require HTTPS (SharedArrayBuffer) - itch.io provides this
