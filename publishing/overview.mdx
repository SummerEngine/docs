## Welcome to Publishing Your Game!

This guide will walk you through **exporting and publishing** your Summer Engine game. We've made it as straightforward as possible, with step-by-step instructions for each platform and distribution method.

<Note>
  New to game publishing? Start with **macOS** or **Windows** export, then publish to **itch.io** for your first release. It's the easiest path to getting your game in players' hands.

## Supported Platforms

### Desktop (Most Common)
- ✅ **Windows** - Largest PC gaming market
- ✅ **macOS** - Growing market, especially with Apple Silicon
- ✅ **Linux** - Includes Steam Deck support

### Mobile
- ✅ **Android** - Google Play Store + third-party stores
- ✅ **iOS** - App Store (requires Apple Developer account)

### Web
- ✅ **HTML5/WebAssembly** - Play in browser (itch.io, Newgrounds, your website)

### Consoles
- 🚧 **Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox** - [See console publishing guide](/publishing/consoles)

## Before You Start

### 1. First-Time Setup (5 minutes)

You need to enable **texture compression** for your target platforms. This is a **one-time** setup per project.

**Go to**: Project → Project Settings → Rendering → Textures → VRAM Compression

**Enable these formats based on where you're releasing**:

| Publishing To | Enable This Format | Why |
|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Mac, iOS, Android** | Import ETC2 ASTC | Apple Silicon & mobile devices use this |
| **Windows, Linux** | Import S3TC BPTC | PC graphics cards use this |
| **Both** | Enable BOTH formats | Most common - covers all desktop platforms |

<Tip>
  **Releasing on Steam to both Mac and Windows?** Enable both ETC2 ASTC and S3TC BPTC. This is the most common setup for indie games.
</Tip>

**What happens when you enable these?**
- Summer will reimport all your textures (takes 1-5 minutes depending on project size)
- Project size increases slightly (~30-50% larger on disk)
- Your game will run on those platforms without texture errors

**Why aren't these enabled by default?**
- Not every game needs every platform (web-only games don't need either format)
- Faster initial project setup for prototyping
- Developer chooses based on target audience

### 2. Test Your Game First!

Before exporting, make sure your game works properly in the editor:
- Run through your game start-to-finish
- Test all major features
- Fix any errors in the Output console

**Export doesn't fix bugs** - it packages your game as-is.

## Typical Publishing Workflow

Here's the recommended order for releasing your first game:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Texture Formats">
    Set up ETC2 ASTC and/or S3TC BPTC based on target platforms (one-time setup)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export for Your Platform">
    Follow the guide for [macOS](/publishing/macos-export) or [Windows](/publishing/windows-export)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Exported Build">
    Run your exported game on a **different computer** (not your dev machine) to catch issues
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish to itch.io (Easiest)">
    [Upload to itch.io](/publishing/itch-io) - no approval process, instant publishing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish to Steam (Optional)">
    [Submit to Steam](/publishing/steam) - larger audience, more complex setup
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need export templates?">
    **No!** Summer Engine **includes export templates** in the download. 
    
    You should be able to export immediately after enabling texture compression formats.
    
    If you see "missing templates" errors, contact support - this shouldn't happen.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export to multiple platforms from one project?">
    **Yes!** Enable both ETC2 ASTC and S3TC BPTC, then create export presets for each platform.
    
    Export Mac, Windows, and Linux builds from the same project. Most Steam games do this.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to code sign my game?">
    **Depends on where you're releasing**:
    
    - **Steam**: No - Steam handles signing for you
    - **itch.io**: No - players expect indie games unsigned
    - **Direct download Mac**: Yes - or users get "unidentified developer" warnings
    - **Direct download Windows**: Optional - prevents "unknown publisher" warnings
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How big will my exported game be?">
    Typical sizes:
    - Small 2D game: 50-150 MB
    - Medium 3D game: 200-500 MB
    - Large 3D game: 500 MB - 2 GB
    
    Summer Engine runtime is ~60MB. The rest is your assets (textures, audio, 3D models).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export for consoles (Switch, PlayStation, Xbox)?">
    Console export requires official developer agreements with platform holders. See our [Console Publishing Guide](/publishing/consoles) for details and recommended porting partners.
