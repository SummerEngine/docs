## Coming Soon

We're building MCP (Model Context Protocol) access to Summer, enabling seamless integration with Cursor, VS Code, and any other IDE that supports MCP. This will let you access Summer's AI capabilities directly from your favorite development environment.

## What's Coming

Our MCP server will provide:

### Seamless IDE Integration
- Access Summer's AI directly from Cursor, VS Code, or any MCP-compatible editor
- Natural language requests without leaving your development environment
- Context-aware responses based on your current project and files

### Game Development Tools
- **Scene Generation**: "Create a main menu scene with these buttons..."
- **Code Analysis**: "Review this player controller for performance issues"
- **Asset Management**: "Generate placeholder sprites for these characters"
- **Architecture Guidance**: "Suggest improvements to this game state system"

### Cross-Project Intelligence
- Summer understands your project structure across different IDEs
- Consistent AI assistance whether you're in Summer or your preferred editor
- Project context that follows you between development environments

### Advanced Workflows
- **Code Review**: Automated code review with game development best practices
- **Documentation**: Generate documentation for your game systems
- **Refactoring**: Large-scale refactoring with game-specific patterns
- **Testing**: Generate unit tests for your game logic and systems

## Use Cases

Here are some exciting ways developers will use Summer's MCP integration:

### Multi-IDE Workflows
- **Design in Summer**: Create game scenes and logic in Summer's visual editor
- **Code in Cursor**: Write complex algorithms with Cursor's AI assistance
- **Debug everywhere**: Get Summer's game-specific debugging help in any environment

### Team Collaboration
- **Consistent AI**: Same AI assistant across different team members' preferred IDEs
- **Shared context**: Summer understands your project regardless of which tool you're using
- **Knowledge transfer**: New team members get AI guidance in their familiar environment

### Specialized Development
- **Shader development**: AI assistance for GLSL/HLSL in specialized shader editors
- **Asset pipeline**: Integrate Summer's AI into your custom build tools and scripts
- **CI/CD integration**: AI-powered code review and testing in your deployment pipeline
