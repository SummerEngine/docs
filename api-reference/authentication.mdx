</Steps>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.summerengine.com/v1/chat" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-summer-..." \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Add a cube to the scene",
    "project_id": "your-project-id"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.summerengine.com/v1/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk-summer-...',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: 'Add a cube to the scene',
    project_id: 'your-project-id'
  })
});
```

```python Python
import requests

headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk-summer-...',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

data = {
    'message': 'Add a cube to the scene',
    'project_id': 'your-project-id'
}

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.summerengine.com/v1/chat',
    headers=headers,
    json=data
)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Rate Limits

API usage is limited by your account tier:

| Tier | Requests/minute | Requests/day |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| Pro  | 60             | 10,000       |
| Enterprise | 300       | 100,000      |

Rate limit headers are included in responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Your rate limit
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Requests remaining
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: When the limit resets

## Error Responses

Authentication errors return HTTP 401:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "message": "Invalid API key",
    "code": "invalid_api_key"
  }
}
```

Common error codes:
- `invalid_api_key`: Key is malformed or doesn't exist
- `insufficient_permissions`: Key doesn't have required permissions
- `rate_limit_exceeded`: You've hit your rate limit
- `account_suspended`: Your account has been suspended

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Keep keys secure**: Never commit API keys to version control or share them publicly.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use environment variables**: Store keys in environment variables, not in code.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Rotate keys regularly**: Generate new keys periodically and delete old ones.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Monitor usage**: Keep track of your API usage to avoid hitting limits.
