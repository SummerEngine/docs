## Installation Issues

- Run as administrator (Windows) or with sudo (Linux)
- Check system requirements are met
- Disable antivirus temporarily during installation

### Missing dependencies
**Symptoms**: "DLL not found" or library errors

**Solutions**:
- Install Visual C++ Redistributables (Windows)
- Update to latest macOS version (macOS)
- Install required packages: `sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev` (Ubuntu)

## AI Chat Issues

### AI not responding
**Symptoms**: Chat shows "Thinking..." indefinitely

**Solutions**:
- Check internet connection
- Verify account authentication
- Restart Summer
- Check if you've hit usage limits

### Poor AI responses
**Symptoms**: AI doesn't understand requests or makes wrong changes

**Solutions**:
- Be more specific in your requests
- Provide context: "In the player script, make the jump higher"
- Break complex requests into smaller parts
- Check if project indexing is complete

## Performance Issues

### Slow project loading
**Symptoms**: Long delays when opening projects

**Solutions**:
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- Exclude project from antivirus scanning
- Use SSD storage for better performance
- Clear Summer's cache: `~/.summer/cache/`

### High memory usage

**Solutions**:
- Close unused projects
- Reduce viewport quality in settings
- Limit concurrent AI operations
- Increase system RAM if possible

## Project Issues

### Changes not applying
**Symptoms**: AI says it made changes but nothing happened

**Solutions**:
- Check if files are read-only
- Ensure you have write permissions
- Look for errors in the output panel
- Try manual undo/redo to refresh

### Lost work
**Symptoms**: Recent changes disappeared

**Solutions**:
- Check version control history
- Look in `~/.summer/backups/` folder
- Use Summer's built-in recovery tool
- Enable auto-save in preferences

## Authentication Problems

### Can't sign in
**Symptoms**: Login fails with valid credentials

**Solutions**:
- Reset password on website
- Clear stored credentials in Summer
- Check firewall isn't blocking Summer
- Try signing in through browser first

### API key issues
**Symptoms**: API calls fail with authentication errors

**Solutions**:
- Regenerate API key in dashboard
