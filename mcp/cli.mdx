## Summer Engine CLI Quick Start

The Summer Engine CLI lets you install the engine, create projects, run the engine, and start the MCP server for Cursor, Claude Code, or Windsurf. Use `npx summer-engine` (no install) or `summer` (after global install).

## Install the Engine

```bash
npx summer-engine install
```

Downloads and installs Summer Engine to your system (macOS: `/Applications/Summer.app`, Windows: default location). No npm global install required.

## Sign In

```bash
npx summer-engine login
```

Opens your browser to sign in with Google, GitHub, or email. Saves your session for analytics and future cloud features.

## Create a Project

```bash
npx summer-engine create 3d-basic my-game
```

Creates a new project from a template. Templates: `empty` (minimal 3D) or `3d-basic` (camera, light, floor).

## Run the Engine

```bash
npx summer-engine run my-game
```

Launches Summer Engine with your project. The engine must be running for MCP tools to work.

## Start MCP (for Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf)

Add this to your IDE's MCP config. You don't run `mcp` manually; the IDE does:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "summer-engine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["summer-engine", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

See [MCP setup](/mcp/setup) for IDE-specific instructions.
