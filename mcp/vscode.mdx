## Summer Engine in VS Code & GitHub Copilot

VS Code and GitHub Copilot's coding agent support MCP (Model Context Protocol). With Summer Engine's integration, the AI can control your game engine: add nodes to scenes, set properties, import assets, run the game, and debug, all from within your coding workflow.

This guide covers both **VS Code** (with Copilot or other AI extensions) and **GitHub Copilot's agent mode**—they use the same MCP configuration.

## Prerequisites

- **VS Code**: With GitHub Copilot (agent mode) or another MCP-aware AI extension
- **Node.js**: For running the MCP server (Node 18+)
- **Summer Engine**: Installed and running with your project open

## Configuration

VS Code reads MCP servers from:

- **Project-level:** `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root (recommended, stays with the project)
- **User-level:** Run **MCP: Open User Configuration** from the Command Palette (⇧⌘P)

### Step 1: Create or Edit the Config File

Create `.vscode/mcp.json` in your project root, or open the user config via **MCP: Open User Configuration**. If the file already exists, add Summer Engine to the existing `servers` object.

### Step 2: Add Summer Engine

<CodeGroup>

```json New file (.vscode/mcp.json)
{
  "servers": {
    "summer-engine": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["summer-engine", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

```json Adding to existing servers
{
  "servers": {
    "other-server": { ... },
    "summer-engine": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["summer-engine", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
**Alternative:** Use **MCP: Add Server** from the Command Palette for a guided setup. Choose "Standard I/O" and enter `npx` as the command with `summer-engine mcp` as arguments.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Restart VS Code

Close and reopen VS Code (or reload the window) so it loads the new MCP config. The Summer Engine MCP server starts when VS Code starts; it connects to the engine on the first tool call.

### Step 4: Verify

1. Run **MCP: List Servers** from the Command Palette
2. You should see **summer-engine** with 23 tools
3. Try a prompt in Copilot Chat: "Use Summer Engine to add a MeshInstance3D with a BoxMesh to the scene"

If the node appears in Summer Engine, the setup is working.

## Using Summer Engine with VS Code / Copilot

Once configured, the AI can use Summer Engine's tools when you ask for game-related changes. Example prompts:

- "Add a Camera3D and DirectionalLight3D to the scene root"
- "Get the scene tree from Summer Engine"
- "Import this model and add it to the World node: [URL]"
- "Run the game and capture a screenshot"
- "Set the project's main scene to res://main.tscn"

<Tip>
**Engine must be running.** VS Code and Copilot talk to Summer Engine over localhost. Open your project in the engine first, or run `npx summer-engine run` from the project directory.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "Summer Engine is not running"

Start Summer Engine and open your project. The MCP server connects to the engine's local API on port 6550. The engine writes a token to `~/.summer/api-token` when it starts.

### MCP server not appearing

- **Config path:** Verify `.vscode/mcp.json` is in your project root (the folder you opened in VS Code)
- **JSON validity:** Ensure no trailing commas, proper quotes, and valid JSON structure
- **Restart:** Fully quit and reopen VS Code

### Tools return errors

See the [Tools Reference](/mcp/tools-reference) for parameter formats. Common issues: wrong node path format (`./World/Player`), invalid property values (use engine string format like `"Vector3(0, 10, 0)"`), or the game running when scene edits are attempted (stop it first with `summer_stop`).
