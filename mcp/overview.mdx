## How Do I Make Games with AI?

Summer Engine is an AI game engine. Describe what you want in natural language ("Add a player that can jump," "Create a main menu," "Import a 3D tree") and the AI modifies your scenes, writes code, and imports assets. No context switching. One environment.

<Card
  title="Make a Game with Just AI"
  icon="sparkles"
  href="/quickstarts/ai-game-dev"
>
  Build a complete game with full AI assistance, no coding required
</Card>

---

## How Do I Make Games with Cursor?

Use Cursor's AI to control Summer Engine. Add the MCP config, open your project, and ask Cursor to add nodes, set properties, import assets, or run the game. The AI has 23 tools: scene manipulation, debugging, project settings. All from your IDE.

<Card
  title="Cursor Setup"
  icon="cursor"
  href="/mcp/cursor"
>
  One-click install or manual config. 2 minutes to get started.
</Card>

---

## How Do I Make Games with Claude Code?

Claude Code can control Summer Engine via MCP. Add the config to `~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`, start the engine, and Claude can modify your game scenes, run the game, and debug, all from the same conversation.

<Card
  title="Claude Code Setup"
  icon="message-square"
  href="/mcp/claude-code"
>
  Add Summer Engine to Claude Code's MCP configuration
</Card>

---

## How Do I Make Games with Windsurf?

Windsurf's AI can use Summer Engine's MCP tools. Configure the MCP server, open your project in the engine, and build games from Windsurf: add nodes, import assets, run and debug.

<Card
  title="Windsurf Setup"
  icon="wind"
  href="/mcp/windsurf"
>
  Configure Windsurf to use Summer Engine's MCP tools
</Card>

---

## How Do I Make Games with Antigravity?

Antigravity's AI can use Summer Engine's MCP tools. Add the config to `.vscode/mcp.json`, open your project in the engine, and build games from Antigravity: add nodes, import assets, run and debug.

<Card
  title="Antigravity Setup"
  icon="rocket"
  href="/mcp/antigravity"
>
  Add Summer Engine to Antigravity's MCP configuration
</Card>

---

## How Do I Make Games with Codex?

Codex can use Summer Engine's MCP tools. Add the config via `codex mcp add` or edit `~/.codex/config.toml`, open your project in the engine, and build games from Codex: add nodes, import assets, run and debug.

<Card
  title="Codex Setup"
  icon="code"
  href="/mcp/codex"
>
  Add Summer Engine to Codex's MCP configuration
</Card>

---

## How Do I Make Games with VS Code or GitHub Copilot?

VS Code and GitHub Copilot's coding agent use the same MCP config. Add Summer Engine to `.vscode/mcp.json`, open your project in the engine, and build games from VS Code or Copilot Chat: add nodes, import assets, run and debug.

<Card
  title="VS Code & GitHub Copilot Setup"
  icon="square-code"
  href="/mcp/vscode"
>
  Add Summer Engine to VS Code or Copilot's MCP configuration
</Card>

---

## How Do I Make Games with Zed?

Zed's Agent Panel can use Summer Engine's MCP tools. Add the config to `context_servers` in settings, open your project in the engine, and build games from Zed: add nodes, import assets, run and debug.

<Card
  title="Zed Setup"
  icon="zap"
  href="/mcp/zed"
>
  Add Summer Engine to Zed's context servers
</Card>

---

## How Do I Use the Summer Engine CLI?

The CLI (`summer` or `npx summer-engine`) installs the engine, creates projects, runs the engine, and starts the MCP server. No global install needed. Use `npx summer-engine install` and `npx summer-engine run`.

<Card
  title="CLI Quick Start"
  icon="terminal"
  href="/cli"
>
  Install, login, create, run. Full CLI introduction.
</Card>
<Card
  title="CLI Reference"
  icon="list"
  href="/ai-tools/cli-reference"
>
  All commands: install, login, create, list, mcp
</Card>

---

## How Do I Use the MCP API?

Summer Engine's MCP server exposes 23 tools over the Model Context Protocol. The same operations the built-in chat uses (AddNode, SetProp, SaveScene, ImportFromUrl) are available to any MCP-compatible AI tool. See the [API Reference](/api-reference/mcp) and [Tools Reference](/ai-tools/tools-reference).

<Card
  title="MCP API Reference"
  icon="book"
  href="/api-reference/mcp"
>
  MCP overview, setup, and quick links
</Card>
<Card
  title="Tools Reference"
  icon="wrench"

  All 23 MCP tools with parameters and examples
</Card>

## Full Engine, All Tools

Summer Engine gives you:

- **23 MCP tools**: Scene (AddNode, SetProp, SaveScene, etc.), Debug (Play, Stop, Snapshots), Project (settings, input, import)
- **Works with existing projects**: No conversion. Tutorials, plugins, and assets work as-is.
- **CLI + MCP + API**: Install via CLI, control via MCP, same local API under the hood
- **One workflow**: Whether you use the built-in chat, Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Antigravity, Codex, VS Code, or Zed, the operations are identical
