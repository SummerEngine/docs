## Summer Engine in Windsurf

Windsurf is an AI-powered IDE that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol). With Summer Engine's integration, Windsurf's AI can control your game engine: add nodes to scenes, set properties, import assets, run the game, and debug, all from within your coding workflow.

This guide covers the configuration. Setup takes about a minute.

## Prerequisites

- **Windsurf**: The Codeium-powered IDE
- **Node.js**: For running the MCP server (Node 18+)
- **Summer Engine**: Installed and running with your project open

## Configuration

Windsurf uses the same MCP config format as Cursor. The config file location may vary by Windsurf version; common locations include:

- **Project-level:** `.cursor/mcp.json` or `.windsurf/mcp.json` in your project root
- **User-level:** `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or `~/.windsurf/mcp.json`

<Note>
**Check Windsurf docs.** MCP config paths can change between versions. If the paths above don't work, check [Windsurf's documentation](https://codeium.com/windsurf) or the in-app MCP settings for the correct config file location.
</Note>

### Step 1: Create or Edit the Config File

Create the MCP config file in your project root or user config directory. If the file already exists (e.g., for other MCP servers), add Summer Engine to the existing `mcpServers` object.

### Step 2: Add Summer Engine

<CodeGroup>

```json New file
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "summer-engine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["summer-engine", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

```json Adding to existing mcpServers
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "other-server": { ... },
    "summer-engine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["summer-engine", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Restart Windsurf

Close and reopen Windsurf so it loads the new MCP config. The Summer Engine MCP server starts when Windsurf starts; it connects to the engine on the first tool call.

### Step 4: Verify

Check Windsurf's MCP or AI settings to confirm "summer-engine" appears with 23 tools. Then try a prompt:

- "Use Summer Engine to add a MeshInstance3D with a BoxMesh to the scene"

If the node appears in Summer Engine, the setup is working.

## Using Summer Engine with Windsurf

Once configured, the AI can use Summer Engine's tools when you ask for game-related changes. Example prompts:

- "Add a Camera3D and DirectionalLight3D to the scene root"
- "Get the scene tree from Summer Engine"
- "Import this model and add it to the World node: [URL]"
- "Run the game and capture a screenshot"
- "Set the project's main scene to res://main.tscn"

<Tip>
**Engine must be running.** Windsurf's AI talks to Summer Engine over localhost. Open your project in the engine first, or run `npx summer-engine run` from the project directory.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "Summer Engine is not running"

Start Summer Engine and open your project. The MCP server connects to the engine's local API on port 6550. The engine writes a token to `~/.summer/api-token` when it starts.

### MCP server not appearing

- **Config path:** Verify you're using the config file Windsurf actually reads. Check the app's MCP settings or documentation.
- **JSON validity:** Ensure no trailing commas, proper quotes, and valid JSON structure
- **Restart:** Fully quit and reopen Windsurf

### Tools return errors

See the [Tools Reference](/mcp/tools-reference) for parameter formats. Common issues: wrong node path format (`./World/Player`), invalid property values (use engine string format like `"Vector3(0, 10, 0)"`), or the game running when scene edits are attempted (stop it first with `summer_stop`).
