## Summer Engine in Codex

Codex is OpenAI's AI coding assistant that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol). With Summer Engine's integration, Codex can control your game engine: add nodes to scenes, set properties, import assets, run the game, and debug, all from within your coding workflow.

This guide covers the configuration. Setup takes about a minute.

## Prerequisites

- **Codex**: OpenAI's AI coding assistant (CLI or IDE extension)
- **Node.js**: For running the MCP server (Node 18+)
- **Summer Engine**: Installed and running with your project open

## Configuration

Codex uses TOML configuration. The config file is:

- **User-level:** `~/.codex/config.toml` (applies to all projects)
- **Project-level:** `.codex/config.toml` in your project root (trusted projects only)

You can configure via the CLI or by editing the config file directly.

### Option 1: CLI (Recommended)

Add Summer Engine with a single command:

```bash
codex mcp add summer-engine -- npx summer-engine mcp
```

### Option 2: Edit config.toml

Create or edit `~/.codex/config.toml` and add:

<CodeGroup>

```toml New file (~/.codex/config.toml)
[mcp_servers.summer-engine]
command = "npx"
args = ["summer-engine", "mcp"]
```

```toml Adding to existing config
[mcp_servers.other-server]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@some/other-mcp"]

[mcp_servers.summer-engine]
command = "npx"
args = ["summer-engine", "mcp"]
```

</CodeGroup>

In the Codex IDE extension, you can open the config via **MCP settings** > **Open config.toml** from the gear menu.

### Step 3: Restart Codex

Close and reopen Codex (or the IDE extension) so it loads the new MCP config. The Summer Engine MCP server starts when Codex starts; it connects to the engine on the first tool call.

### Step 4: Verify

In the Codex TUI, use `/mcp` to see your active MCP servers. You should see "summer-engine" with 23 tools. Then try a prompt:

- "Use Summer Engine to add a MeshInstance3D with a BoxMesh to the scene"

If the node appears in Summer Engine, the setup is working.

## Using Summer Engine with Codex

Once configured, Codex can use Summer Engine's tools when you ask for game-related changes. Example prompts:

- "Add a Camera3D and DirectionalLight3D to the scene root"
- "Get the scene tree from Summer Engine"
- "Import this model and add it to the World node: [URL]"
- "Run the game and capture a screenshot"
- "Set the project's main scene to res://main.tscn"

<Tip>
**Engine must be running.** Codex talks to Summer Engine over localhost. Open your project in the engine first, or run `npx summer-engine run` from the project directory.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "Summer Engine is not running"

Start Summer Engine and open your project. The MCP server connects to the engine's local API on port 6550. The engine writes a token to `~/.summer/api-token` when it starts.

### MCP server not appearing

- **Config path:** Verify `~/.codex/config.toml` exists (or `.codex/config.toml` for project scope)
- **TOML syntax:** Ensure valid TOML (no trailing commas, proper section headers)
- **Restart:** Fully quit and reopen Codex

### Tools return errors

See the [Tools Reference](/mcp/tools-reference) for parameter formats. Common issues: wrong node path format (`./World/Player`), invalid property values (use engine string format like `"Vector3(0, 10, 0)"`), or the game running when scene edits are attempted (stop it first with `summer_stop`).
