## Summer Engine in Zed

Zed is a fast, AI-powered code editor that supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) through its Agent Panel. With Summer Engine's integration, Zed's AI can control your game engine: add nodes to scenes, set properties, import assets, run the game, and debug, all from within your coding workflow.

This guide covers the configuration. Setup takes about a minute.

## Prerequisites

- **Zed**: The high-performance editor with built-in AI
- **Node.js**: For running the MCP server (Node 18+)
- **Summer Engine**: Installed and running with your project open

## Configuration

Zed uses `context_servers` in its settings. You can add Summer Engine via:

- **Settings file:** `~/.config/zed/settings.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/zed/settings.json` on Linux)
- **Project-level:** `.zed/settings.json` in your project root (create via **zed: open project settings**)
- **UI:** Agent Panel → Settings → **Add Custom Server**

### Step 1: Open Settings

Press `Cmd+,` (Mac) or `Ctrl+,` (Linux/Windows), or run **zed: open settings** from the Command Palette. For project-specific config, run **zed: open project settings** to create `.zed/settings.json`.

### Step 2: Add Summer Engine

Add the `context_servers` entry. If it already exists, add `summer-engine` to the object:

<CodeGroup>

```json New context_servers
{
  "context_servers": {
    "summer-engine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["summer-engine", "mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

```json Adding to existing context_servers
{
  "context_servers": {
    "other-server": { ... },
    "summer-engine": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["summer-engine", "mcp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

### Step 3: Restart Zed

Close and reopen Zed so it loads the new config. The Summer Engine MCP server starts when Zed starts; it connects to the engine on the first tool call.

### Step 4: Verify

1. Open the **Agent Panel** (top-right menu or Command Palette)
2. Go to **Settings** and check the context servers list
3. A green dot next to **summer-engine** means it's active
4. Try a prompt: "Use Summer Engine to add a MeshInstance3D with a BoxMesh to the scene"

If the node appears in Summer Engine, the setup is working.

## Using Summer Engine with Zed

Once configured, the AI can use Summer Engine's tools when you ask for game-related changes. Example prompts:

- "Add a Camera3D and DirectionalLight3D to the scene root"
- "Get the scene tree from Summer Engine"
- "Import this model and add it to the World node: [URL]"
- "Run the game and capture a screenshot"
- "Set the project's main scene to res://main.tscn"

<Tip>
**Engine must be running.** Zed's AI talks to Summer Engine over localhost. Open your project in the engine first, or run `npx summer-engine run` from the project directory.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "Summer Engine is not running"

Start Summer Engine and open your project. The MCP server connects to the engine's local API on port 6550. The engine writes a token to `~/.summer/api-token` when it starts.

### MCP server not appearing or red dot

- **Config path:** Verify settings are in `~/.config/zed/settings.json` or `.zed/settings.json` in your project
- **JSON validity:** Ensure no trailing commas, proper quotes, and valid JSON structure
- **Restart:** Fully quit and reopen Zed

### Tools return errors

See the [Tools Reference](/mcp/tools-reference) for parameter formats. Common issues: wrong node path format (`./World/Player`), invalid property values (use engine string format like `"Vector3(0, 10, 0)"`), or the game running when scene edits are attempted (stop it first with `summer_stop`).
