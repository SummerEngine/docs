**Yes.** Summer is built by game developers, for game developers. We shipped *Don't Pray* on Steam, a P2P 3D PvP co-op game with multiplayer networking, combat systems, and Steam integration, in 2.5 months. A project that would have taken us 1-2 years before Summer. It's not a demo; it's a commercial product.
