## Yes: No Coding Required

You can build complete games by describing what you want in plain English. Summer Engine writes the code, creates assets, and sets up your game. No coding experience required. This is sometimes called **AI game dev** or **vibe coding for games**. You focus on the creative vision; Summer Engine handles the implementation.

## What You Can Ask For

Summer Engine understands natural language. You don't need to be precise. Examples:

**Game systems:** "Create a 2D platformer with double jump," "Add a health bar and damage system," "Build a main menu with Start and Settings"

**Assets:** "Generate a low-poly tree for my forest," "Create a wooden crate texture," "Add footsteps on gravel"

**Mechanics:** "Make the camera follow my player," "Add enemies that chase the player," "Implement a scoring system"

**UI:** "Add a pause menu," "Create a settings screen with volume sliders," "Build an inventory panel"

## How It Works

1. You describe what you want. Summer Engine shows you a plan of what it will change.
2. You review and approve. Changes go through safe operations. Nothing breaks unexpectedly.
3. You iterate. "Make the jump higher," "Add more platforms," "Change the enemy speed."
4. Every change is undoable with Ctrl+Z.

Summer Engine doesn't just suggest code. It implements directly in your project. When you ask for "a health system for my player," it creates the script, connects it to your player scene, and sets up any required UI. Assets it generates (textures, 3D models, audio) are placed in the right folder and connected automatically.

## What Summer Engine Can Build

**Game logic.** Character controllers, inventory systems, AI behaviors, network sync for multiplayer. Production-ready code that integrates with your existing codebase.

**Visual assets.** UI textures, tilesets, character sprites, particle effects. AI-generated, clearly labeled. Good for prototyping and indie aesthetics.

**Audio.** Background music, sound effects, ambient loops. Summer Engine integrates with ElevenLabs and other providers.

**Documentation.** Code comments, design docs, technical guides. Living documentation that stays current.

## Learning as You Go

Summer Engine explains what it's doing as it builds. If you want to understand the engine, Summer Engine acts as an infinite tutor. If you just want to ship a game, describe it and let Summer Engine handle the rest.
