## What is Summer Engine?

Summer Engine is **the AI game engine**. It's not just a game engine with a plugin bolted on. It's a professional engine built from the ground up for AI, where the AI understands your entire project and can modify scenes, code, and assets through natural language commands.

**Think of it as Cursor for game development.** Instead of juggling ChatGPT, VS Code, and another engine, you work in one unified environment. You describe what you want; Summer Engine writes the code, creates assets, and modifies your game directly.

## How Summer Engine Differs from Other Approaches

**Unified experience.** No switching between tools. The AI understands your project context because it indexes your codebase, scenes, and assets. When you ask "add a health bar to my player," it knows which player script and scene to modify.

**Safe operations.** AI changes go through engine APIs with full undo support. Nothing breaks unexpectedly. Every change can be reverted with Ctrl+Z.

**Project intelligence.** Summer Engine automatically indexes your project when you open it: scripts, scenes, assets, and their relationships. The AI uses this to give context-aware help, not generic advice.

**Specialist agents.** For complex tasks (3D modeling, audio design, physics), Summer Engine can bring in domain experts that run in parallel and stay focused on their area.

## Who Is Summer Engine For?

Summer Engine is for everyone who wants to make games. Beginners can build complete games by describing them in plain English. Professionals get a production-ready tool that accelerates workflow. We shipped a commercial Steam game in 2.5 months using Summer Engine. You get full access to the underlying engine and complete control over your architecture.
