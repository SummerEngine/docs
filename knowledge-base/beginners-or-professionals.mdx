**Summer is for everyone.** We believe making games should be as fun as playing them.

- **For Beginners & Vibe Coders**: You can build complete games just by describing them in plain English. Summer Engine handles the code, assets, and scene setup. It's the perfect way to "vibe code" your dream game into existence without needing years of experience.
- **For Professionals**: Summer is a production-ready tool that accelerates your workflow. We shipped a commercial Steam game (*Don't Pray*) in 2.5 months using Summer. You get full access to the underlying engine, clean code generation, and complete control over your architecture.
