## You Don't Need Any Experience

Summer Engine is designed for people who've never made a game. You describe what you want in plain English. Summer Engine writes the code, creates assets, and sets up your game. No coding, no engine tutorials, no prior knowledge required.

## The Path

**1. Download Summer Engine.** Visit [summerengine.com](https://summerengine.com). Download for Mac or Windows. Free. No credit card.

**2. Create an account.** Open Summer Engine, click Sign in. Use Google, GitHub, or email. Takes a minute.

**3. New Project.** Click New Project. Give it a name (e.g. "My First Game"). Choose a folder. Click Create & Open.

**4. Describe your game.** In the chat panel, type what you want. Examples:
- "Create a simple platformer where I can jump"
- "Make a clicker game with a counter"
- "Build a top-down game where I move with WASD"

**5. Iterate.** Summer Engine builds it. You playtest (press Play). Want changes? "Add more platforms." "Make the character jump higher." "Add a score." Summer Engine updates it.

## What You'll Learn

Summer Engine explains what it's doing as it builds. You'll see the code it creates, the nodes it adds, the logic it implements. If you want to understand game development, Summer Engine acts as a tutor. If you just want to ship a game, you can stay at the "describe what you want" level.

## The Learning Curve

For vibe coding (describe and build), the curve is near zero. For mastering the engine, Summer Engine teaches you as you go. It's one of the fastest ways to learn game development because you're learning by doing, with an AI that can answer any question.

## Common First Steps

After your first game is running, try:
- "Add a main menu with Start and Quit"
- "Generate a character sprite for my player"
- "Add sound effects when I jump"
- "Make the camera follow my player smoothly"

Each request teaches you something new. No need to study first. Just build.
