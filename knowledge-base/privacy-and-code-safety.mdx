## Yes—Privacy is the Default

Privacy Mode is enabled by default for every Summer Engine user. No settings to toggle, no premium tier for privacy. Your code stays on your machine. We don't train AI models on user data. We don't store your code long-term. We don't share it with anyone.

## What We Do With Your Code

**When you ask Summer Engine for help:**
- We send the minimal necessary context to AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) to generate responses
- We index your codebase for project intelligence so Summer Engine understands your project
- We temporarily hold it during the conversation for context
- We delete everything when the session ends

**Encryption:** All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). Your code is never sent over unencrypted connections.

## What We Never Do

- Train AI models on your code
- Store your code permanently on our servers
- Share your code with other users or companies
- Sell access to your data
- Use your code for any purpose except helping you build games

## Zero Retention

Your code is deleted immediately after we respond. Not after 30 days. Not when you close Summer Engine. Immediately. We don't keep copies for debugging, analytics, or service improvement.

**Exception:** Conversation history within an active chat is temporarily stored so Summer Engine can understand context. When you start a new chat or close Summer Engine, this is deleted too.

## Local-First Processing

Project intelligence runs locally whenever possible. Summer Engine analyzes your codebase on your machine without sending it to our servers. Only when you ask Summer Engine to generate or modify code do we send the minimal necessary context to AI providers—and only for that specific request.

## AI Provider Agreements

We use zero-retention agreements with Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI (GPT), and Google (Gemini). They see your code only during your active request. They never see it for analytics, debugging, or model training.

## What's Protected

Everything: scripts, shaders, config files, art, audio, models, project structure, comments, conversation history, usage patterns, error messages. We treat all of it as proprietary to your game development.
