## Founders Respond Personally

We're a small team. Email founders@summerengine.com for any questions, bugs, or feature requests. We respond personally to every inquiry, typically within 24 hours. No ticket queues, no bots.

## Where to Get Help

**Email.** founders@summerengine.com. Best for detailed technical questions, bug reports, or anything that benefits from a written thread.

**Discord.** [discord.gg/yUpgtxnZky](https://discord.gg/yUpgtxnZky). Active community of Summer Engine users. Good for quick questions, sharing work, and getting feedback. The founders are in there too.

**Documentation.** You're reading it. The Knowledge Base, quickstarts, and guides cover most common questions. AI agents can also use our docs. Mintlify auto-generates llms.txt for discoverability.

## What to Include When Reaching Out

**For bugs:** What you were doing, what you expected, what happened. Screenshots or error messages help. Your OS and Summer Engine version.

**For feature requests:** Describe the use case. What are you trying to do? Why would this help?

**For general questions:** Just ask. We're happy to help.

## Response Times

We aim to respond to email within 24 hours on business days. Discord is often faster. Someone from the community or the team may answer within minutes.
