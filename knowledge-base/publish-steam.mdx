## Overview

Publishing to Steam involves building your game in Summer Engine, exporting for Windows (and/or Mac), creating a Steamworks account, paying the Steam Direct fee, and submitting your build. Summer Engine includes export templates—you don't need to install anything extra. The export process is the same as for itch.io or direct download; Steam is another distribution channel.

## Step-by-Step

**1. Build your game.** Create and polish your game in Summer Engine with AI assistance.

**2. Enable texture compression.** Before exporting, go to Project → Project Settings → Rendering → Textures → VRAM Compression. Enable S3TC BPTC for Windows, ETC2 ASTC for Mac. If releasing on both, enable both at once.

**3. Export.** Project → Export → Add → Windows Desktop (or macOS). Configure (64-bit, Embed PCK for single .exe), then Export. You get a standalone build.

**4. Create Steamworks account.** Go to [partner.steampowered.com](https://partner.steampowered.com). Sign up, pay the $100 Steam Direct fee (one-time per game).

**5. Set up your store page.** App name, description, screenshots, trailer, tags, age rating. Steam has specific requirements for each.

**6. Upload your build.** Use the Steamworks upload tools. Configure depots, build IDs, and release branches. Test with the Steam client.

**7. Submit for review.** Steam reviews your build and store page. Typically 1-3 days. They check for malware, broken builds, and policy compliance.

**8. Release.** Once approved, you choose your release date. You can do a soft launch (visible but not featured) or a full launch.

## Requirements

- **Steamworks account** — Free to create
- **$100 Steam Direct fee** — One-time per game, not per update
- **Valid business/payment info** — For payouts
- **Build that runs** — Test on a clean machine before submitting

## Revenue Share

Steam takes 30% of sales. You keep 70%. This is standard for the platform.

## Tips

**Test your exported build on a different computer.** Not your dev machine. Catches missing DLLs, wrong paths, and other export issues.

**Use the same bundle identifier** across Mac and Windows if you're releasing on both. Important for cloud save continuity.

**Start with itch.io** if you want a quicker path to release. No approval process, no fee. Use that to validate, then add Steam later.
