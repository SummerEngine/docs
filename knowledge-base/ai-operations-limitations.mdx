## What Works Well

Summer Engine's AI can do a lot directly in your project:

**Scene modifications.** Add nodes, set properties, connect signals. "Add a CharacterBody2D named Player." "Set the Button text to 'Start Game'." "Connect the Button's pressed signal to start_game." Changes appear immediately in the editor.

**Script operations.** Create scripts, attach them to nodes, open your external editor for code. Summer Engine writes production-ready code that integrates with your existing codebase.

**Asset import.** Import 3D models, textures, and audio from Summer Studio. "Import a low-poly tree for my forest." "Build a village: houses, trees, fences, and props." Summer Engine searches, downloads, runs the import pipeline, and places assets. Bulk import is supported. Many assets in one batch.

**Project settings.** Change main scene, physics layers, window size. Add input actions (jump, movement, controller mappings).

**Game systems.** Character controllers, inventory systems, AI behaviors, network sync. Summer Engine builds complete systems, not just snippets.

All changes go through **safe operations** with full undo support. Every change can be reverted with Ctrl+Z. Nothing breaks unexpectedly.

## Current Limitations

**No batch code refactors.** Large refactors across many files (e.g., rename a function in 50 files) are not supported yet. Bulk asset import is supported; bulk code refactors are not.

**Limited import settings.** Asset import options are mostly manual for now. You may need to adjust import settings in the editor for some assets.

**Scene-focused.** Works best with open scenes rather than project-wide changes. For cross-scene refactors, you may need to do it scene by scene.

**Shell commands require approval.** Summer Engine can propose shell commands (run tests, install deps, run scripts), but nothing executes until you approve it. This is by design. You stay in control.

## What's Safe

- All operations are undoable (Ctrl+Z)
- Editor APIs only. No direct file manipulation that could corrupt projects
- Explicit operations. AI must specify exactly what it's changing
- Immediate feedback. Changes appear instantly so you can verify

## Best Practices

**Review before applying.** The change review panel shows exactly what will be modified. Check it before confirming.

**Save regularly.** Save your scenes after AI makes changes you want to keep. This persists changes to your project files.

**Use undo freely.** Don't hesitate to undo AI changes that aren't quite right. You can always ask for a different approach.
