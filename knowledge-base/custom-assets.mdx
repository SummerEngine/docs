## Yes: Your Assets Work

Summer Engine supports standard asset formats. You can import your own 2D art, 3D models, and audio. AI generation is optional. Many developers use a mix: their own art for key assets, AI for placeholders or iteration.

## How to Import

**Drag and drop.** Drag files into the project folder or use the import dialog. Standard formats work: PNG, JPG, WebP for images; OBJ, FBX, glTF for 3D; WAV, OGG, MP3 for audio.

**Import dialog.** Use the engine's standard import flow. Summer Engine doesn't change how importing works. It's the same as the underlying engine.

**Summer Studio.** You can also upload and organize assets in Summer Studio, then have Summer Engine import them into your project on command. "Import the tree asset from my collection."

## AI Generation Is Optional

You don't have to use AI for assets. If you have an artist, use their work. If you buy assets from stores, use those. Summer Engine's AI generation is there when you need placeholders, quick concepts, or iteration, not as a requirement.

## Mixing Your Assets and AI

Common workflow: Use AI to generate placeholder art during development. When you're ready to ship, replace key assets with human-created art. Or use AI for props and environments, humans for main characters and key art. Summer Engine doesn't care. It works with whatever assets you have.

## Asset Integrity

Summer Engine doesn't modify your source asset files unless you ask it to. When Summer Engine generates an asset, it's clearly labeled as AI-generated. Your imported assets stay yours. The engine handles them the same way regardless of source.
